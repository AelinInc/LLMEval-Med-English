      "groupCode": 5,
      "sanswer": "β-OH蒽醌比α-OH蒽醌酸性更强的原因主要与分子结构中的共振效应、氢键作用和空间位阻有关：\n\n1. **共振效应**：在β-OH蒽醌中，羟基（OH）的位置使得氧原子上的负电荷可以更有效地与蒽醌的共轭体系进行共振。这种共振效应有助于稳定去质子化后的负离子（酚酸根离子），从而增强酸性。\n\n2. **氢键作用**：在α-OH蒽醌中，羟基可能会与相邻的羰基氧形成较强的内氢键。这种内氢键使得羟基中的氢更难以释放，从而降低其酸性。而在β-OH蒽醌中，内氢键的影响较小，因此羟基中的氢更容易释放，表现出更强的酸性。\n\n3. **空间位阻**：α位的羟基由于靠近羰基，可能受到空间位阻的影响，使得去质子化过程不如β位的羟基那么容易。\n\n综上所述，β-OH与羰基处于同一个共轭体系中，受羰基吸电子作用的影响，使羟基上氧的电子云密度降低，质子容易解离，酸性较强。",

      "problem_en": "Why is β-hydroxyanthraquinone more acidic than α-hydroxyanthraquinone?",
      "answer_en": "β-OH anthraquinone is more acidic than α-OH anthraquinone mainly due to resonance effects, hydrogen bonding, and steric hindrance in the molecular structure:\n\n1. **Resonance effects**: In β-OH anthraquinone, the position of the hydroxyl group (OH) allows the negative charge on the oxygen atom to resonate more effectively with the anthraquinone conjugated system. This resonance effect helps stabilize the deprotonated anion (phenoxide ion), thereby enhancing acidity.\n\n2. **Hydrogen bonding**: In α-OH anthraquinone, the hydroxyl group may form relatively strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the adjacent carbonyl oxygen. This intramolecular hydrogen bond makes the hydrogen in the hydroxyl less readily released, thereby reducing its acidity. In β-OH anthraquinone, the influence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding is smaller, so the hydrogen in the hydroxyl is released more easily, exhibiting stronger acidity.\n\n3. **Steric hindrance**: The hydroxyl at the α-position, being near the carbonyl, may be affected by steric hindrance, making the deprotonation process less facile than for the hydroxyl at the β-position.\n\nIn summary, β-OH is in the same conjugated system as the carbonyl, and under the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl, the electron density on the oxygen of the hydroxyl is reduced, the proton dissociates more readily, and the acidity is stronger.",

      "answer_en": "Saponins are a class of natural compounds found in many plants with a variety of biological activities, including hemolysis. The hemolytic action of saponins is mainly due to their interaction with cell membranes. The specific mechanisms include:\n\n1. **Surfactant properties**: Saponin molecules have hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, which endow them with surfactant properties. They can insert into the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane, altering its structure and permeability.\n\n2. **Membrane disruption**: After binding to membrane lipids, saponins decrease membrane stability, increase membrane fluidity and permeability, leading to rupture of the cell membrane or pore formation, and ultimately causing leakage of cellular contents.\n\n3. **Cholesterol binding**: Saponins can bind cholesterol in the cell membrane, compromising membrane integrity. Since erythrocyte membranes contain relatively high cholesterol, they are more susceptible to the effects of saponins, leading to hemolysis.\n\n4. **Effects on membrane proteins**: Saponins may interact with membrane proteins, altering their conformation or function, further affecting membrane stability.\n\nIn summary, upon contact with erythrocytes, saponins bind cholesterol on the erythrocyte membrane to form insoluble molecular complexes, disrupt the normal permeability of erythrocytes, increase the osmotic pressure of the erythrocyte, thereby compromising the cell membrane and causing hemolysis.",

      "answer_en": "The strength of hemolytic action can be represented by **Hemolysis index**. The Hemolysis index refers to the minimum concentration of a saponin solution that completely lyses red blood cells under certain conditions (such as isotonic, buffered solution and constant-temperature environment, using red blood cells from the same animal source). This index reflects the ability of saponin to damage red blood cells; a lower value indicates stronger hemolytic action, and a higher value indicates weaker hemolytic action.\n\nThe strength of hemolytic action is related to the molecular structure of the saponin. For example, monoglycoside saponins usually exhibit more pronounced hemolytic action, while diglycoside saponins may be weaker or have no hemolytic action. In addition, acidic saponins' hemolytic action lies between monoglycoside and diglycoside saponins.\n\nHere are some specific saponin hemolysis index examples:\n\n| Saponin type | Hemolysis index |\n| --- | --- |\n| Glycyrrhizin saponin | 1:4000 |\n| Dioscorea saponin | 1:400000 |\n\nThese values indicate that, under the same conditions, glycyrrhizin saponin has stronger hemolytic action than dioscorea saponin because it can completely lyse red blood cells at a lower concentration.\n\nIt should be noted that saponins from different sources may have different hemolysis indices, so in practical applications, evaluations should be based on the specific circumstances.

Chemical structural features: First-generation sulfonylurea drugs possess the basic structure of benzenesulfonylurea, with para-substituents on the benzene ring commonly including methyl, chlorine, acetyl groups.\n\n2. Metabolic pathways: The main metabolic pathway is the oxidation of these para substituents. For example, the para-methyl group in tolbutamide is readily oxidized and inactivated, with a duration of action of 6–12 hours, classifying it as a short-acting sulfonylurea. Other drugs such as tolazamide and chlorpropamide also exhibit similar metabolic pathways, but the rate of metabolism and duration of activity differ.\n\n3. Excretion: First-generation sulfonylureas are mainly excreted by the kidneys.\n\nII. Second-generation sulfonylureas\n\n1. Chemical structural features: Compared with the first generation, second-generation sulfonylureas have larger substituent chains at the para position of the benzene ring bearing the sulfonyl group; the terminal urea moiety often carries lipophilic rings or nitrogen-containing lipophilic rings.\n\n2. Metabolic pathways: The metabolic pathways of second-generation drugs differ greatly from the first; the main pathway is oxidative hydroxylation of the lipophilic ring, leading to inactivation. Taking glibenclamide as an example, its major metabolites are trans-4-hydroxyglibenclamide and cis-3-hydroxyglibenclamide, both of which retain about 15% activity.\n\n3. Excretion: The excretion pathways of second-generation sulfonylureas also differ from the first generation, with about half excreted via bile into the intestinal tract and half excreted via the kidneys.\n\nIn summary, first- and second-generation sulfonylureas differ significantly in chemical structure, metabolic pathways, and excretion routes.

      "problem": "吃饭时头上、手心老是冒汗，便秘持续了小一个月，这是什么病？",
      "groupCode": 19,
      "sanswer": "根据您描述的吃饭时头上、手心老是冒汗以及持续一个月的便秘情况，这可能与多种健康问题有关，以下是一些可能的原因和相应的建议：\n\n### 冒汗的可能原因深入分析\n\n1. **正常生理现象与体质因素**：\n- 您在吃饭时头上、手心冒汗，可能部分原因是正常的生理反应，特别是如果食物较热或环境气温较高。然而，如果这种出汗情况比常人更为显著，且伴随其他如乏力、气短等症状，可能与您的体质有关。中医理论中，气虚、阴虚或湿热体质都可能导致出汗异常。气虚体质者容易出汗且汗多不黏，阴虚体质者则可能在夜间或进食辛辣后出汗明显，而湿热体质者则可能伴有身体沉重、口黏口苦等症状。\n\n2. **多汗症**：\n- 如果您在其他情况下（如非进食时）也经常出现手心、脚心或头部出汗，且这种出汗情况对您的日常生活造成了困扰，那么您可能患有特发性多汗症。这种病症通常与交感神经系统的过度活跃有关，可能需要专业的医疗干预，如药物治疗或手术治疗。\n\n3. **疾病因素**：\n- 除了上述原因外，某些疾病也可能导致出汗异常。例如，糖尿病可能导致自主神经功能紊乱，从而引起出汗异常；甲状腺功能亢进症则可能导致身体代谢率增高，进而引起出汗增多。这些疾病通常还伴随其他症状，如糖尿病可能伴随多饮、多尿、体重减轻等，甲状腺功能亢进症可能伴随心悸、手抖、消瘦等。\n\n### 便秘的可能原因深入分析\n\n1. **饮食与生活习惯**：\n- 您的便秘情况可能与饮食和生活习惯密切相关。如果膳食中缺乏足够的纤维素和水分，或者饮食过于精细、缺乏粗粮和果蔬，都可能导致肠道蠕动减缓，引起便秘。此外，缺乏运动、久坐不动也可能影响肠道的蠕动功能。\n\n2. **肠道疾病与药物副作用**：\n- 某些肠道疾病，如结肠炎、肠梗阻、直肠肿瘤等，可能导致肠道功能异常，从而引起便秘。同时，某些药物（如降压药、抗抑郁药、钙剂等）也可能导致便秘作为副作用出现。如果您正在服用这些药物，并且便秘情况与药物使用有关，那么您可能需要与医生沟通调整药物剂量或更换药物。\n\n3. **精神心理因素**：\n- 精神心理因素也是导致便秘的重要原因之一。长期紧张焦虑、压力过大可能影响自主神经功能，导致肠道蠕动紊乱。此外，抑郁、焦虑等情绪问题也可能导致食欲不振、消化不良等间接影响肠道健康。\n\n### 综合建议\n\n针对您的情况，我建议：\n\n1. **调整饮食**：增加膳食纤维和水分的摄入，多吃富含纤维素的食物（如蔬菜、水果、全谷类等），避免过多摄入高脂肪、高蛋白和刺激性食物。\n\n2. **适量运动**：增加身体活动量，特别是进行有氧运动（如快走、慢跑、游泳等），以促进肠胃蠕动和血液循环。\n\n3. **调节心态**：保持良好的心态和情绪稳定，避免过度紧张焦虑。可以尝试进行放松训练、冥想或心理咨询等以缓解压力。\n\n4. **就医检查**：如果便秘和出汗情况持续或加重，建议及时就医检查以排除可能的器质性疾病。医生可能会根据您的症状和体征进行相关的检查（如血常规、血糖、甲状腺功能检查、肠镜检查等）。\n\n5. **中医治疗**：可以考虑寻求中医的帮助，通过中药调理体质和肠道功能。中医医生会根据您的具体症状进行辨证施治，给出个性化的治疗方案。\n\n总之，您的症状可能涉及多个方面的因素，需要综合考虑和调整。希望以上分析能对您有所帮助，并祝您早日恢复健康！",

      "problem_en": "During meals, there is persistent diaphoresis of the scalp and palms; constipation has persisted for nearly a month. What is the diagnosis?",
      "answer_en": "### In-depth analysis of possible causes of sweating\n\n1. **Normal physiological phenomena and constitutional factors**:\n- Sweating on the scalp and palms during meals may partly be a normal physiological response, especially if the food is hot or the ambient temperature is high. However, if this sweating is more pronounced than in the general population and is accompanied by other symptoms such as fatigue or shortness of breath, it may be related to your constitution. In traditional Chinese medicine, qi deficiency, yin deficiency, or damp-heat constitution can lead to abnormal sweating. Qi-deficient individuals tend to sweat easily with sweat that is plentiful but not sticky; yin-deficient individuals may sweat more at night or after eating spicy foods; and damp-heat constitution may be accompanied by symptoms such as heaviness, sticky mouth, and a bitter taste in the mouth.\n\n2. **Hyperhidrosis**:\n- If you frequently sweat from the palms, soles, or head in other situations (not just during meals), and this sweating interferes with daily life, you may have primary hyperhidrosis. This condition is usually related to overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and may require professional medical intervention, such as pharmacologic treatment or surgical treatment.\n\n3. **Disease factors**:\n- In addition to the above, certain diseases may cause sweating abnormalities. For example, diabetes may lead to autonomic dysfunction, causing abnormal sweating; hyperthyroidism may increase metabolic rate, leading to increased sweating. These diseases are usually accompanied by other symptoms, such as diabetes with polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss; hyperthyroidism with palpitations, tremor, and weight loss.\n\n### In-depth analysis of possible causes of constipation\n\n1. **Diet and lifestyle**:\n- Your constipation may be closely related to diet and lifestyle. If the diet lacks adequate dietary fiber and fluids, or is overly refined and lacks whole grains and fruits/vegetables, this can slow intestinal peristalsis and cause constipation. Additionally, lack of exercise and prolonged sedentary behavior can affect bowel motility.\n\n2. **Intestinal diseases and drug side effects**:\n- Certain intestinal diseases, such as colitis, bowel obstruction, rectal tumors, etc., may lead to abnormal bowel function and constipation. At the same time, certain medications (such as antihypertensives, antidepressants, calcium supplements, etc.) may cause constipation as a side effect. If you are taking these medications and constipation is related to drug use, you may need to discuss with your doctor about adjusting the dosage or changing medications.\n\n3. **Psychological factors**:\n- Psychological factors are also an important cause of constipation. Chronic tension and anxiety, excessive stress may affect autonomic function, leading to disordered bowel motility. Additionally, mood issues such as depression and anxiety may also lead to reduced appetite, dyspepsia, and other indirect effects on gut health.\n\n### Integrated recommendations\n\nFor your situation, I suggest:\n\n1. **Dietary adjustments**:\n- Increase intake of dietary fiber and fluids, eat more fiber-rich foods (such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, etc.), and avoid excessive intake of high-fat, high-protein, and irritating foods.\n\n2. **Moderate exercise**:\n- Increase physical activity, especially aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking, jogging, swimming, etc.), to promote bowel movement and blood circulation.\n\n3. **Mood regulation**:\n- Maintain a positive mindset and emotional stability, avoid excessive tension and anxiety. You can try relaxation training, meditation, or psychological counseling to relieve stress.\n\n4. **Medical examination**:\n- If constipation and sweating persist or worsen, seek medical evaluation promptly to rule out potential organic disease. The physician may order relevant tests based on your symptoms and signs (such as complete blood count, blood glucose, thyroid function tests, colonoscopy, etc.).\n\n5. **Traditional Chinese medicine treatment**:\n- Consider seeking help from traditional Chinese medicine to regulate constitution and intestinal function through herbal medicine. A TCM practitioner will diagnose and treat according to your specific symptoms, providing a personalized treatment plan.\n\nIn summary, your symptoms may involve factors from multiple domains and require comprehensive consideration and adjustment. I hope the above analysis is helpful, and I wish you a speedy return to health!",

In severe ascites, the abdomen becomes markedly distended, and an umbilical hernia may occur.\n2. **Formation of collateral circulation**:\n\n* **Esophagogastric varices**: This is the most common collateral pathway; dilated veins are prone to rupture and bleeding, causing hematemesis and melena, among other severe symptoms.\n* **Abdominal wall varices**: Under portal hypertension, the abdominal wall veins dilate to form varices, presenting as blue or purple venous networks beneath the skin of the abdominal wall.\n* **Hemorrhoidal varices**: Some patients may develop hemorrhoidal varices, presenting as worsening hemorrhoids or recurrent episodes.\n\n3. **Splenomegaly with hypersplenism**: Portal hypertension leads to enlargement of the spleen, which in turn causes hypersplenism. Hypersplenism results in decreases in all blood cell lines, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets; patients are prone to anemia, bleeding, and infections.\n\n### Clinical manifestations of liver dysfunction\n\n1. **Digestive and absorptive disorders**: such as decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension and a tendency toward diarrhea.\n2. **Malnutrition**: patients often present with weight loss, fatigue, and lethargy, among other signs of malnutrition.\n3. **Jaundice**: due to the liver’s reduced ability to metabolize bilirubin, leading to elevated bilirubin levels in the blood and the appearance of jaundice.\n4. **Bleeding and anemia**: The liver’s synthesis of coagulation factors decreases, leading to coagulopathy; patients are prone to epistaxis, gum bleeding, and petechiae or ecchymoses on the skin and mucous membranes. In severe cases, there may be gastrointestinal bleeding.\n5. **Endocrine disorders**: such as hepatopathic facies and spider nevi. Spider nevi result from reduced hepatic function and decreased inactivation of estrogen, leading to dilation of cutaneous capillaries.\n6. **Hypoalbuminemia**: due to decreased hepatic synthesis of albumin, patients commonly develop edema of the lower limbs and ascites.\n\n### Precautions\n\nFor patients with cirrhosis-associated portal hypertension and liver dysfunction, timely medical consultation and professional treatment are required. At the same time, patients should adjust their diet and lifestyle, avoid spicy or irritating foods, maintain balanced nutrition, and keep a positive mindset.\n\nIn summary, portal hypertension with cirrhosis can lead to liver dysfunction, mainly due to hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis, the development of collateral circulation, and the appearance of abnormal anastomotic vessels.

Follow-up costs may be hundreds of yuan to over one thousand yuan per visit, and rehabilitation training costs vary by rehabilitation facility and program. If complications occur, corresponding treatment is needed, which adds extra costs. Costs for managing complications depend on the specific situation and may range from several thousand yuan to tens of thousands.\n\n### IV. Impact of medical insurance policy\n\nIn China, some coronary stents have been included in the medical insurance reimbursement, which to some extent reduces patients’ financial burden. However, for stents or procedures not covered by insurance or with low reimbursement rates, patients may need to bear higher costs. Therefore, the specific reimbursement rates and costs should be consulted with the local medical insurance department.\n\n### V. Summary\n\nIn summary, the cost of coronary stent implantation results from the interplay of many factors. Generally, the cost of coronary stent implantation ranges roughly from 30,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan. For patients needing a coronary stent implantation, besides price considerations, attention should also be paid to stent quality, procedural outcomes, and postoperative rehabilitation. At the same time, maintaining healthy living habits and regular physical examinations are important measures to prevent cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk associated with coronary stent implantation.",

      "answer_en": "Renal insufficiency patients after coronary stent implantation indeed have a possibility of recurrence, but this is not directly caused by renal insufficiency, rather it is related to multiple factors. The following is a detailed analysis of this issue and postoperative precautions:\n\n### 1. Recurrence after coronary stent implantation in patients with renal insufficiency\n\nRecurrence after coronary stent implantation typically refers to in-stent restenosis or the recurrence of cardiovascular events. This is mainly related to the following factors:\n\n1. **Baseline disease control**: Poor control of underlying diseases such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes is an important cause of recurrence after coronary stent implantation. If these conditions are not effectively controlled, it will accelerate the progression of vascular disease.\n2. **Lifestyle**: Unhealthy lifestyle such as high-salt, high-fat, and high-sugar diets, smoking, drinking, and staying up late can also increase the risk of recurrence after coronary stent implantation.\n3. **Surgical factors**: The surgical operation itself, the choice of stent, and placement location can also affect stent patency and long-term outcomes.\n\nRenal insufficiency itself does not directly cause recurrence after coronary stent implantation, but patients with renal insufficiency may require more careful management of underlying diseases and medication use due to metabolic abnormalities and slowed drug excretion.\n\n### 2. Postoperative precautions\n\nFor renal insufficiency patients, after undergoing coronary stent implantation, pay special attention to the following:\n\n1. **Strict control of underlying diseases**:\n- Follow the doctor’s instructions, take medications on time, ensure blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid levels are within normal ranges.\n- Regularly monitor liver and kidney function to timely adjust drug doses and treatment plans.\n\n2. **Lifestyle adjustments**:\n- Maintain a low-sodium, low-fat, and low-sugar diet; avoid excessive intake of sodium, fats, and cholesterol.\n- Quit smoking and limit alcohol, engage in moderate exercise, control weight, avoid overexertion and emotional agitation.\n\n3. **Regular medication**:\n- Adhere to prescribed medications, especially antiplatelet therapy and lipid-lowering drugs, to prevent thrombosis and restenosis.\n- Be aware of drug interactions and adverse effects; seek medical attention promptly if uncomfortable.\n\n4. **Regular follow-up and reexamination**:\n- Postoperative regular follow-up to monitor changes in condition and promptly identify and address any potential problems.\n- Perform necessary rechecks as advised by the doctor, such as angiography, to assess stent status and other vascular conditions.\n\n5. **Special attention to renal function protection**:\n- When using medications, choose drugs with minimal impact on renal function.\n- Avoid drugs that may damage renal function, such as certain antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nIn summary, renal insufficiency patients after coronary stent implantation need to manage their health with extra caution. Through strict control of underlying diseases, lifestyle adjustments, regular medication, regular follow-up and reexaminations, and special attention to renal function protection, the risk of recurrence can be reduced and recovery promoted.",

      "answer_en": "### Time to detachment of absorbable sutures\n\nThe timing of detachment of absorbable sutures varies depending on the type, thickness, and patient constitution. Generally, absorbable sutures are gradually absorbed or detached by the body after surgery for a period. The specific times are as follows:\n\n* **Protein-based absorbable sutures and finer gauge**: Generally, absorption and detachment can occur 7 to 10 days postoperatively.\n* **Medium-short-acting absorbable sutures and thicker gauge**: Detachment time may require about 1 month.\n* **Long-acting absorbable sutures**: The time to absorption is longer, with some taking 2 to 3 months to detach.\n\nAdditionally, there are viewpoints that absorbable sutures may shed on their own during the postoperative recovery period (e.g., within two weeks to two months). The exact timing depends on the suture material, the type of surgery, and individual differences. Therefore, if detachment has not occurred for a long time, you may consult the treating physician for professional advice.\n\n### Medications for edema reduction\n\nEdema after surgery is common and can be alleviated with medication. Here are some commonly used medications for reducing edema:\n\n* **迈之灵片**: The main component is horse chestnut extract, which can be used to treat venous edema and related symptoms. It can decrease vascular permeability and increase venous return, thereby reducing edema.\n* **地奥司明片**: The main component is diosmin, which can be used to treat various symptoms related to venous and lymphatic insufficiency. It can increase venous tone, decrease vascular permeability, and promote lymphatic and venous return, thereby reducing edema.\n* **Antibiotics**: Such as amoxicillin capsules, cefradine capsules, etc., mainly used to treat inflammation and edema caused by infection. They inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis or protein synthesis, thereby exerting antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects.\n* **Diuretics for edema relief**: Such as furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide, etc., can be used to promote urination and diuresis. However, kidney function and electrolyte balance should be monitored during use.\n* **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs**: Such as ibuprofen, etc., can be used for postoperative analgesia and to reduce swelling caused by fever.\n\nPlease note that the above medications should be used under the guidance of a physician; do not purchase and take them yourself. At the same time, after surgery you should also keep the wound clean and dry to prevent infection; maintain adequate rest and a reasonable diet to promote recovery.\n\nIn summary, the detachment time of absorbable sutures varies by individual differences, and the choice of edema-relief medications should also be decided by a physician based on the specific situation. If you have any concerns or discomfort, please consult a professional doctor promptly.",

Therefore, at eight months of gestation, a widest intestinal diameter of about 1.27 cm may fall within the normal range, but it could also indicate some abnormality.\n\nPossible causes of fetal intestinal dilation include the following:\n\n1. **Physiological factors**: During development, the fetus may temporarily experience dilation of the intestinal tract, which may later revert to normal on its own.\n2. **Congenital intestinal atresia**: A congenital developmental abnormality of the intestine that leads to intestinal obstruction and dilation.\n3. **Intestinal obstruction**: May be due to intestinal adhesions, intussusception, or other causes, preventing normal passage of intestinal contents and resulting in bowel dilation.\n4. **Congenital megacolon**: Due to a lack of ganglion cells, leading to impaired intestinal peristalsis and dilation of the bowel.\n5. **Chromosomal abnormalities**: Such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and other chromosomal diseases, which may be accompanied by intestinal developmental anomalies, presenting as bowel dilation.\n\nRegarding your situation, although the 1.27 cm bowel width may be within the normal range, this does not completely rule out the possibility of an intestinal malformation. Therefore, the following measures are recommended:\n\n1. **Regular follow-up**: Under a physician’s guidance, regularly perform ultrasound examinations to monitor changes in the fetal intestinal width.\n2. **Further investigations**: If the intestinal width continues to widen or other abnormal indicators are present, consider more detailed evaluations, such as MRI and chromosomal testing, to clarify whether there is an intestinal malformation or other developmental abnormalities.\n3. **Maintain a positive mindset**: During pregnancy, maintaining a good mental state is crucial for fetal development. Do not become excessively anxious or worried; follow the doctor’s recommendations for prenatal checkups and follow-up.\n\nIn summary, although a 1.27 cm intestinal width may suggest a fetal intestinal abnormality, it could also be transient dilation due to physiological factors. Therefore, close monitoring and further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause. At the same time, the pregnant woman should maintain a good mindset and healthy eating habits to create favorable conditions for the fetus’s healthy development.",

      "problem_en": "In individuals with a history of varicella, what adverse reactions may occur after administration of the varicella vaccine?",
      "answer_en": "### I. General Reactions\n\n1. **Mild Immune Response**:\n- After vaccination with the varicella vaccine, the body may mount a mild immune response, such as redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site, or a mild fever. This is a normal immune response and usually resolves on its own within a few days to about a week.\n\n2. **Allergic Reactions**:\n- A very small number of people may be allergic to certain components of the vaccine, presenting with rash, itching, or more severe allergic reactions such as difficulty breathing. If these symptoms occur, seek urgent medical attention.\n\n### II. Special Circumstances\n\n1. **Excessive Rash Development**:\n- Due to the body's memory immune response to the varicella-zoster virus, after vaccination there may be excessive rash development, accompanied by fever, malaise, and other symptoms. However, this is rare.\n\n2. **Boosted Secondary Immune Response**:\n- After vaccination, the body will generate a certain amount of antibodies, but over time they may weaken or disappear. A subsequent vaccination can stimulate the body to produce a stronger immune response to enhance immunity.\n\n3. **Asymptomatic Infection or Secondary Infection**:\n- People who have previously had chickenpox already have immune memory cells against this virus; upon re-exposure to the same antigen, these cells can quickly recognize and clear the pathogen, so there are no obvious clinical manifestations. However, due to the high variability of varicella-zoster virus, there is a risk of secondary infection.\n\n### III. Recommendations and Precautions\n\n1. **Observing Reactions**:\n- After vaccination, closely monitor for bodily responses. If discomfort occurs, such as persistent high fever or severe itching, seek medical attention promptly.\n\n2. **Personal Circumstances**:\n- Reactions to the varicella vaccine vary from person to person and are related to factors such as individual immune status and vaccination history. Therefore, before vaccination, inform your doctor in detail about your health status and medical history.\n\n3. **Significance of Vaccination**:\n- Generally, people who have had chickenpox do not need to receive the varicella vaccine again, because chickenpox infection usually provides lifelong immunity. However, for immunocompromised individuals or certain occupations (e.g., healthcare workers), it may be necessary to consider vaccination on a case-by-case basis to boost immunity.\n\nIn summary, after having had chickenpox and receiving the varicella vaccine, possible reactions include mild immune reactions and allergic reactions. But in most cases it is safe, and the reactions are mild. If symptoms occur, seek medical attention promptly.",

Content requirements: Describe the possible physiological reactions that may occur when receiving the varicella vaccine again after having had varicella, including mild immune responses (such as redness at the injection site and mild fever) and, in very rare cases, allergic reactions.\n\nSecondary requirements:\n1. Explain the possibility of enhanced secondary (anamnestic) immune responses and their impact on immunity.\n2. Emphasize the need to observe the body's responses after vaccination, and seek medical attention promptly if severe discomfort occurs.\n3. Point out that the necessity of varicella vaccination varies by individual; generally, people who have had varicella do not need to be re-vaccinated, but there may be exceptions for special populations."

Tubal Infusion Test\n\n* **Procedure**: The physician inserts a catheter into the uterine cavity, and then injects a certain amount of liquid (such as normal saline, phenol red solution, etc.) into the uterus and fallopian tubes via the catheter.\n* **Assessment criteria**: If the liquid can pass smoothly through the fallopian tubes into the peritoneal cavity, the fallopian tubes are patent; if resistance is encountered during injection and the patient experiences lower abdominal pain, this may indicate tubal blockage.\n\n### 2. Hysterosalpingography\n\n* **Procedure**: Under fluoroscopy, the physician injects a contrast agent into the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes through a catheter, then takes X-ray images.\n* **Assessment criteria**: The contrast agent clearly displays the morphology and contours of the uterus and fallopian tubes and whether the fallopian tubes are patent. If the fallopian tubes are patent, the contrast agent will distribute evenly within the peritoneal cavity; if the tubes are obstructed, the contrast agent will stagnate at the site of the blockage.\n\n### 3. Laparoscopy\n\n* **Procedure**: Through several small incisions in the abdomen, a laparoscope is inserted into the abdominal cavity.\n* **Assessment criteria**: Laparoscopy can directly observe the morphology of the fallopian tubes, the presence of adhesions and blockages, and can provide timely treatment for any issues found.\n\n### 4. Ultrasound\n\n* **Procedure**: Performed via transvaginal ultrasound or transabdominal ultrasound.\n* **Assessment criteria**: Ultrasound can observe the morphology, structure of the fallopian tubes and surrounding tissues. However, it should be noted that ultrasound has relatively lower diagnostic accuracy for tubal obstruction and is usually combined with other examination methods for a comprehensive assessment.\n\n### Precautions\n\n* **Timing**: It is generally recommended to perform the examination 3-7 days after the onset of menses, when the endometrium is thinner, reducing endometrial injury during the procedure and lowering the risk of bleeding and infection.\n* **Pre-examination preparation**: Avoid sexual activity for one week before the examination; sexual activity may alter the vaginal environment, increase infection risk, and also affect the accuracy of the examination results.\n* **Personal hygiene**: Maintain personal hygiene and keep the vulvar area clean prior to the examination.\n\n### Overall considerations\n\nBecause each patient's situation is different, clinicians will select the most appropriate examination method based on the patient's medical history, symptoms, and signs. In some cases, multiple tests may be required to comprehensively determine tubal patency. If tubal obstruction is detected, patients should seek medical care promptly and receive appropriate treatment.\n\nIn addition, for patients with a history of uterine fibroid removal surgery, during preconception care it is also necessary to pay attention to other factors that may affect pregnancy, such as the recovery of the endometrium and changes in hormone levels, to improve the chances of conceiving. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation and examination under a physician’s guidance is recommended.",

      "sanswer": "Hawkins征在距骨骨折的评估和预测中具有重要意义，特别是在预测距骨颈骨折后是否会发生坏死方面。以下是对Hawkins征能否预测距骨颈骨折坏死的详细分析：\n\n### Hawkins征的定义\n\nHawkins征是指在踝关节前后位X线片上，距骨圆顶皮质下出现一横行的透亮带的影像学特征。这个透亮带的出现与距骨的血液供应状况密切相关。\n\n### Hawkins征与距骨颈骨折坏死的关系\n\n1. **血供的指示**：\n- Hawkins征的出现提示照射部位骨废用与制动，骨吸收大于重建，这是骨主动性充血所致，表明血运较好。因此，出现Hawkins征通常意味着距骨的血供未受损害，发生骨梗死的风险较低。\n\n2. **坏死的预测**：\n- Hawkins征阴性（即未出现透亮带）则高度怀疑距骨可能发生无菌性坏死。多项研究表明，Hawkins征阴性对缺血坏死的敏感度较高，提示血运障碍、缺血坏死风险较高。\n\n3. **骨折分型的关联**：\n- Hawkins征的出现与距骨的骨折部位、分型、合并骨折有关。例如，Hawkins Ⅰ型距骨颈骨折（无移位）通常坏死风险较低，而Hawkins Ⅱ型至Ⅳ型（伴有移位和/或关节脱位）的坏死风险逐渐增高。在这些高风险骨折类型中，若未出现Hawkins征，则更需警惕坏死的可能性。\n\n### 临床应用\n\n1. **术后观察**：\n- Hawkins征在距骨骨折术后观察中具有重要意义。术后6-8周复查X线片时，若未出现Hawkins征，则可能需要采取更积极的治疗措施来预防缺血坏死。\n\n2. **辅助治疗决策**：\n- 对于Hawkins征阴性的患者，医生可能会考虑使用局部药物注射等保守治疗方法来改善微循环、扩张血管，从而帮助恢复距骨骨折处的血运，预防缺血坏死。\n\n### 结论\n\n综上所述，Hawkins征能够作为预测距骨颈骨折后是否会发生坏死的一个重要指标。虽然它并非绝对准确，但结合骨折类型、临床表现和其他影像学特征，可以为医生提供有价值的参考信息，以制定更合理的治疗方案和预后评估。",

      "answer_en": "Hawkins sign plays an important role in the assessment and prediction of talus fractures, especially in predicting whether necrosis will occur after a talar neck fracture. The following is a detailed analysis of whether Hawkins sign can predict necrosis after talar neck fracture:\n\n### Definition of Hawkins sign\n\nHawkins sign refers to the radiographic feature of a horizontal radiolucent band subchondrally on the anteroposterior and lateral views of the ankle joint. The appearance of this radiolucent band is closely related to the status of the talar blood supply.\n\n### Relationship between Hawkins sign and avascular necrosis of the talar neck fracture\n\n1. **Indication of blood supply**:\n- The appearance of Hawkins sign suggests disuse and immobilization of the affected bone region; bone resorption exceeds formation, which is due to active hyperemia, indicating relatively good perfusion. Therefore, the presence of Hawkins sign usually implies that the talus’ blood supply is not compromised, and the risk of avascular necrosis is low.\n\n2. **Prediction of necrosis**:\n- Hawkins sign negativity (i.e., failure to show the radiolucent band) strongly raises suspicion that the talus may undergo aseptic necrosis. Several studies have shown that a negative Hawkins sign has high sensitivity for ischemic necrosis, indicating higher risk of vascular compromise and ischemic necrosis.\n\n3. **Association with fracture type**:\n- The appearance of Hawkins sign is related to the fracture site, classification, and concomitant fractures of the talus. For example, Hawkins type I talar neck fractures (non-displaced) typically have a lower risk of necrosis, while Hawkins types II to IV (with displacement and/or joint dislocation) have progressively higher necrosis risk. In these high-risk fracture types, if Hawkins sign is absent, the possibility of necrosis should be even more vigilantly monitored.\n\n### Clinical applications\n\n1. **Postoperative observation**:\n- Hawkins sign has important meaning in the postoperative observation of talar fractures. When re-evaluating radiographs at 6–8 weeks postoperatively, if Hawkins sign is not present, more proactive treatment measures may be required to prevent avascular necrosis.\n\n2. **Adjunctive treatment decisions**:\n- For patients with a negative Hawkins sign, clinicians may consider conservative treatment methods such as local drug injections to improve microcirculation and vasodilation, thereby helping restore blood flow at the fracture site and prevent ischemic necrosis.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, Hawkins sign can serve as an important indicator for predicting whether avascular necrosis will occur after a talar neck fracture. Although it is not absolutely definitive, when combined with fracture type, clinical presentation, and other imaging features, it can provide valuable reference information to guide more rational treatment planning and prognosis assessment.",

      "answer_en": "Jeune syndrome (Jeune syndrome, JS), also known as asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, is a genetically heterogeneous disease. Its inheritance pattern and disease-associated gene mutations are as follows:\n\n### I. Inheritance pattern\n\nThe inheritance pattern of Jeune syndrome is mainly autosomal recessive. This means that an affected individual must inherit two identical recessive pathogenic alleles from both parents to manifest the disease. If both parents are carriers of defective Jeune-related genes, their children have a 25% risk of developing the disease.\n\n### II. Gene mutations associated with the disease\n\nTo date, at least 10 disease-causing genes have been identified for Jeune syndrome, and these genes play important roles in the structure and function of primary cilia in mammalian organisms. The following are some gene mutations associated with Jeune syndrome:\n\n| Gene name | Function and impact |\n| --- | --- |\n| DYNC2H1 | The encoded protein plays an important role in skeletal development and also affects tissues such as the kidney, liver and biliary system, and retina. Mutations in this gene account for about half of all cases. |\n| CEP120 | Involved in the formation and function of ciliary structures; mutations may lead to ciliary dysfunction. |\n| CSPP1 | Gene related to intraflagellar transport proteins; mutations may cause abnormal ciliary assembly or function. |\n| IFT80 | Related to intraflagellar transport; mutations affect normal ciliary assembly and signaling. |\n| IFT140, IFT172 | Also intraflagellar transport protein genes; mutations may cause ciliary dysfunction. |\n| TTC21B | Function not fully understood, but mutations are associated with Jeune syndrome. |\n| WDR19, WDR34, WDR35, WDR60 | Involved in maintenance and function of ciliary structure; mutations may lead to ciliary abnormalities. |\n| TCTEX1D2 | May be related to ciliary function; mutations may also cause Jeune syndrome. |\n\n### III. The relationship between cilia and the disease\n\nCilia are microscopic structures on the surface of human cells, and during embryonic development they play an important guiding role in the normal development of the skeleton and other organs. The pathogenic genes carried by Jeune syndrome patients can cause dysfunction of proteins related to ciliary structure, further affecting skeletal morphology during embryonic development, while also producing malformations in other organ systems, including polycystic kidney disease and optic nerve damage.\n\n### IV. Genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis\n\nBecause Jeune syndrome is an autosomal recessive inherited disease, if there is a previous affected child in the family, other family members should first undergo genetic counseling to assess the risk of disease in offspring. Those who are already pregnant can also undergo prenatal diagnosis through genetic testing to terminate the pregnancy in a timely manner and avoid the birth of affected fetuses.\n\nIn summary, Jeune syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disease with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Multiple gene mutations associated with Jeune syndrome have been identified, mainly involving genes encoding intraflagellar transport proteins and related structural proteins.",

Complete Blood Count:\n- Decreased red blood cell count: DBA patients typically have a markedly reduced red blood cell count.\n- Reticulocytopenia: Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells produced in the bone marrow; DBA patients' reticulocyte counts are reduced.\n- Decreased hemoglobin: Due to reduced red blood cells, hemoglobin levels also fall.\n- White blood cell and platelet counts normal: Unlike aplastic anemia, DBA patients usually have normal white blood cell and platelet counts.\n\n2. Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy:\n- Bone marrow smears show a markedly reduced or absent erythroid lineage: In DBA patients, erythroid cells are markedly reduced and may be absent, while granulocytic and megakaryocytic cells are usually normal.\n- Bone marrow biopsy helps clarify marrow architecture and cellular distribution, further supporting the diagnosis of DBA.\n\n3. Iron Metabolism Studies:\n- Serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, and other indices may be elevated, but not specific indicators. These tests help assess the body's iron stores and exclude anemia due to other iron metabolism abnormalities.\n\n4. Hemolytic Anemia Tests:\n- Direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) and acidified serum test (Ham test), etc.; these tests are usually negative, helping to exclude other types of hemolytic anemia.\n\n5.

      "problem_en": "Does this disease have a genetic predisposition? If so, which genes are involved?",
      "answer_en": "Genetic predisposition\nCongenital pure red cell aplasia (DBA), also known as Diamond-Blackfan Anemia, is a rare congenital pure red cell aplasia. The disease has hereditary characteristics, and familial congenital pure red cell aplasia is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that if there is a confirmed patient in the family, the risk of disease in offspring increases accordingly. However, not all individuals carrying pathogenic variants will develop the disease, as there are other factors such as environmental factors and other unknown factors that may influence disease expression.\n\nRelated genes\nThe genetic mechanism of DBA is complex and involves multiple genes. Through linkage analyses, scientists have identified at least three genetic loci associated with DBA, of which two loci have been confirmed, located at 19q13.2 and 8p23.3-p22. In the 19q13.2 region, the related pathogenic gene, namely the ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) gene, has been cloned. Sequence analysis shows that about 25% of DBA patients have mutations in RPS19.\n\nOther possible modes of inheritance\nIn addition to autosomal dominant inheritance, DBA's genetic patterns may also include autosomal recessive inheritance or X-linked inheritance. However, it should be noted that the specific proportions and mechanisms of these inheritance patterns have not been fully clarified.\n\nClinical manifestations and diagnosis\nDBA's clinical manifestations mainly include anemia, developmental abnormalities, and an increased predisposition to tumors. Most patients develop anemia symptoms soon after birth and may be accompanied by congenital developmental abnormalities, such as malformations of the heart, kidneys, and genitourinary organs. Additionally, DBA patients are more prone to tumors than age-matched normal individuals.\n\nDiagnosis of DBA typically relies on clinical presentation, complete blood counts, bone marrow aspiration, and genetic testing, among other methods. Genetic testing plays a crucial role in confirming DBA, especially for those with a family history.\n\nIn summary, congenital pure red cell aplasia indeed has a genetic predisposition, and the RPS19 gene has been identified as one of its pathogenic genes. Nevertheless, the disease’s genetic mechanism is complex, involving multiple genes and loci, so further research is needed to elucidate its mode of inheritance and pathogenesis. For individuals with a family history, routine complete blood count tests and monitoring ferritin levels, etc., should be performed to enable early detection and intervention of potential issues.",

For adult patients, the recommended dose is 0.1 g per dose (i.e., 1 tablet), twice daily. This dose is derived from multiple clinical trials and clinical practice, intended to balance efficacy and safety.\n\n### 2. Treatment Duration\n\nThe course of etoricoxib tablets is typically 8 weeks. If multiple treatment courses are needed, the cumulative duration of use should be limited to 24 weeks. However, the specific treatment duration and dose adjustments should be determined according to the patient’s specific condition and the clinician’s judgment.\n\n### 3. Precautions for Use\n\n1. Take after meals: Etoricoxib tablets are recommended to be taken after meals to reduce gastrointestinal irritation.\n2. Swallow the tablet whole: Do not chew, break, or crush the tablet.\n3. Avoid concomitant use with other NSAIDs: Etoricoxib may interact with other NSAIDs, increasing the risk of adverse reactions.\n4. Monitor liver and renal function: Patients on long-term etoricoxib should have periodic monitoring of liver and renal function and complete blood counts.\n5. Contraindications: Women of childbearing potential; patients with hypersensitivity to this product or other COX-2 inhibitors and sulfonamides; patients who develop asthma, urticaria, or allergic reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs should not use etoricoxib.\n\n### 4. Special Considerations for Tenosynovitis\n\nAlthough etoricoxib can be used to relieve pain associated with osteoarthritis, the specific treatment of tenosynovitis should consider factors such as the severity of inflammation and individual differences. Therefore, at the first onset of tenosynovitis, it is recommended to consult a physician or pharmacist to determine whether etoricoxib is appropriate and to determine a specific dosing plan.\n\n### 5. Summary\n\nFor patients with a first episode of tenosynovitis, if etoricoxib therapy is considered, the recommended daily dose is 0.1 g (1 tablet), twice daily. However, the exact dosing regimen should be determined based on the patient’s specific condition and the physician’s judgment. During treatment, it is important to follow the physician’s instructions and the drug labeling to ensure safe and effective use.",

      "groupCode": 84,
      "sanswer": "Omega-3脂肪酸（通常指ω-3脂肪酸）对人体激素平衡有多方面的益处，主要体现在以下几个方面：\n\n### 一、促进雌激素的正常分泌\n\nOmega-3脂肪酸对女性的生殖健康具有积极的影响。它可以通过影响雌激素的合成和代谢，促进雌激素的正常分泌，这是女性生殖健康的重要组成部分。同时，它还能提高女性的排卵功能并改善卵巢疾病，有助于改善月经规律症状。这些作用有助于维持女性体内荷尔蒙的平衡。\n\n### 二、改善整体内分泌功能\n\n虽然Omega-3脂肪酸直接针对特定激素平衡的研究可能不如对雌激素那样明确，但它对整体内分泌系统的积极影响是广泛认可的。Omega-3脂肪酸具有抗炎特性，可以减轻体内的炎症反应，而炎症是内分泌失调的一个重要因素。通过减轻炎症，Omega-3脂肪酸可能有助于改善内分泌功能，从而间接促进激素平衡。\n\n### 三、对心血管健康的影响\n\nOmega-3脂肪酸对心血管健康的益处也可能间接影响激素平衡。例如，它可以降低胆固醇水平、减少血液黏稠度，从而改善心脑血管的健康。这些作用有助于降低高血压风险、调节血脂水平，预防动脉粥样硬化等心血管疾病。而心血管健康与内分泌系统密切相关，因此Omega-3脂肪酸对心血管健康的益处也可能有助于维持激素平衡。\n\n### 四、其他可能的益处\n\n此外，Omega-3脂肪酸还可能通过其他机制影响激素平衡。例如，它可以增加高密度脂蛋白胆固醇水平，防止斑块在动脉中积聚，并阻止血液凝块。这些作用有助于改善血液循环和代谢功能，从而可能对激素平衡产生积极影响。\n\n### 五、注意事项\n\n需要注意的是，虽然Omega-3脂肪酸对人体激素平衡有多方面的益处，但并非万能药。对于存在激素平衡问题的人群来说，还需要寻求专业医生的帮助和指导。此外，Omega-3脂肪酸的摄入量也需要适量控制，过量摄入可能带来不必要的健康风险。\n\n综上所述，Omega-3脂肪酸对人体激素平衡具有多方面的益处，包括促进雌激素的正常分泌、改善整体内分泌功能、对心血管健康的积极影响等。然而，在摄入Omega-3脂肪酸时也需要注意适量控制，并在专业医生的指导下进行。",

      "problem_en": "What are the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids for human hormonal balance?",
      "answer_en": "Omega-3 fatty acids (commonly referred to as ω-3 fatty acids) have multiple benefits for human hormone balance, mainly reflected in the following aspects:\n\n### I. Promotion of Normal Estrogen Secretion\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids have a positive impact on female reproductive health. They can influence the synthesis and metabolism of estrogens, promoting normal estrogen secretion, which is an important component of female reproductive health. At the same time, they can also enhance female ovulatory function and improve ovarian disorders, helping to improve menstrual regularity symptoms. These effects help maintain hormonal balance within women.\n\n### II. Improvement of Overall Endocrine Function\n\nAlthough research directly targeting the balance of specific hormones may not be as clear for Omega-3 fatty acids as for estrogen, their positive impact on the overall endocrine system is widely recognized. Omega-3 fatty acids possess anti-inflammatory properties and can reduce inflammatory responses in the body, and inflammation is an important factor in endocrine dysregulation. By reducing inflammation, Omega-3 fatty acids may help improve endocrine function, thereby indirectly promoting hormonal balance.\n\n### III. Effects on Cardiovascular Health\n\nThe benefits of Omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular health may also indirectly influence hormonal balance. For example, they can lower cholesterol levels and reduce blood viscosity, thereby improving cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health. These effects help reduce the risk of hypertension, regulate lipid levels, and prevent atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases. And since cardiovascular health is closely related to the endocrine system, the benefits of Omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular health may also help maintain hormonal balance.\n\n### IV. Other Potential Benefits\n\nIn addition, Omega-3 fatty acids may influence hormone balance through other mechanisms. For example, they can increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, prevent plaque buildup in arteries, and prevent blood clots. These effects help improve blood circulation and metabolic function, thereby potentially exerting a positive influence on hormone balance.\n\n### V. Precautions\n\nIt should be noted that although Omega-3 fatty acids have multiple benefits for human hormone balance, they are not a panacea. For individuals with hormone balance problems, it is necessary to seek help and guidance from a healthcare professional. In addition, Omega-3 fatty acid intake should be moderate; excessive intake may pose unnecessary health risks.\n\nIn summary, Omega-3 fatty acids have multiple benefits for human hormone balance, including promoting normal estrogen secretion, improving overall endocrine function, and positive effects on cardiovascular health. However, when consuming Omega-3 fatty acids, it is important to maintain moderate intake and to proceed under the guidance of a healthcare professional.",

      "answer_en": "Post-laser hyperpigmentation is **usually temporary**, but the exact duration of resolution depends on multiple factors, including individual constitution, postoperative care, and the size and depth of the hyperpigmentation. The following is a detailed analysis of this issue:\n\n### Causes of Hyperpigmentation\n\nHyperpigmentation after laser surgery can have multiple causes, including postoperative infection, dietary triggers, and inadequate sun protection. These factors can contribute to worsening local tissue damage, thereby triggering hyperpigmentation.\n\n### Duration of Hyperpigmentation Resolution\n\n* Generally, post-laser hyperpigmentation tends to gradually fade over a period of time. This time frame can range from ten days to three months, but it may take longer, such as six months, one year, or even longer.\n* The duration of resolution is closely related to the individual's constitution. If skin repair ability is strong and metabolism is vigorous, the fading time will be relatively shorter. Conversely, if skin repair ability is weak and metabolism is slow, the fading time will be relatively longer.\n* Postoperative care is also an important factor affecting the time to resolution of hyperpigmentation. Measures such as keeping the local skin clean and dry, avoiding infection, and paying attention to sun protection all help accelerate the resolution of hyperpigmentation.\n\n### Methods to Accelerate Hyperpigmentation Resolution\n\n* If hyperpigmentation persists or fades slowly, several measures can be taken to speed its resolution. For example, brightening products containing antioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin E, or aesthetic procedures such as Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) photorejuvenation and glycolic acid peels.\n* Laser treatment itself can also be used to improve hyperpigmentation. However, when undergoing laser treatment again, ensure the skin has stabilized and follow the physician's recommendations and guidance.\n\n### Precautions\n\n* After laser surgery, patients should follow their physician's recommendations for postoperative care to reduce the occurrence of hyperpigmentation and accelerate its resolution.\n* If hyperpigmentation persists or worsens, seek medical attention promptly and obtain guidance from a professional physician.\n\nIn summary, post-laser hyperpigmentation is usually temporary, but the specific resolution time varies from person to person. Through proper postoperative care and necessary treatment measures, the resolution of hyperpigmentation can be accelerated.",

      "sanswer": "当老公是A型血，老婆是O型血时，生宝宝需要注意以下几点：\n\n### 一、血型遗传与新生儿溶血病\n\n* **血型遗传**：根据血型遗传规律，A型血（AA或AO）和O型血（OO）结合，生出的孩子血型可以是A型血（AO或AA）或O型血（OO）。\n* **新生儿溶血病风险**：若母亲为O型血，父亲为A型血，胎儿可能为A型血，有发生新生儿溶血病的风险。这是因为母亲血液中的抗体可能攻击孩子红细胞，导致红细胞破坏，引发溶血病。\n\n### 二、孕期保健与检查\n\n* **血型抗体效价检测**：在孕期，建议定期进行血型抗体效价检测，以监测母亲体内抗A抗体的浓度。若抗体效价过高，可能需要采取相应治疗措施。\n* **产检项目**：除常规检查外，还应关注血型抗体效价检测。此外，按时进行产检，包括唐筛、大排畸等，以了解胎儿发育情况。\n\n### 三、新生儿观察与护理\n\n* **黄疸观察**：孩子出生后要密切观察黄疸情况。新生儿溶血病可能导致黄疸出现较早、程度较重。若黄疸出现过早（如24小时内）、上升速度快、程度重或持续不退，应立即就医。\n* **日常护理**：保持宝宝皮肤清洁，注意保暖。尽量早开奶，让宝宝多吸吮母乳，促进胎便排出，这有助于减轻黄疸。\n\n### 四、营养补充与心理调适\n\n* **营养补充**：保证蛋白质、维生素、矿物质等营养均衡摄入，如瘦肉、蔬菜、水果等。\n* **心理调适**：保持良好心态，避免焦虑和紧张。可通过适当运动、听音乐等方式缓解孕期压力。\n\n### 五、特殊情况处理\n\n* **接受异基因造血干细胞移植**：虽然这种情况较为罕见，但若接受异基因造血干细胞移植并移植成功，患者的血型可能会变成供体的血型。此时需要密切监测血型变化及相关健康问题。\n\n综上所述，当老公是A型血，老婆是O型血时，生宝宝需要注意血型遗传与新生儿溶血病的风险、孕期保健与检查、新生儿观察与护理以及营养补充与心理调适等方面。同时，也要关注特殊情况的处理。",

      "problem_en": "The husband is blood type A, the wife is blood type O. What precautions should be considered during pregnancy?",
      "answer_en": "### I. Blood Type Inheritance and Neonatal Hemolytic Disease\n\n* **Blood Type Inheritance**: According to the rules of blood type inheritance, A type (AA or AO) and O type (OO) crosses can produce children with type A (AO or AA) or type O (OO).\n* **Risk of Neonatal Hemolytic Disease**: If the mother is type O and the father is type A, the fetus may be type A, with a risk of neonatal hemolytic disease (HDN). This is because antibodies in the mother's blood may attack the baby's red blood cells, causing hemolysis and HDN.\n\n### II. Prenatal Care and Examinations\n\n* **Blood Type Antibody Titer Testing**: During pregnancy, regular blood type antibody titer testing is recommended to monitor the concentration of anti-A antibodies in the mother. If the antibody titer is too high, corresponding treatment measures may be needed.\n* **Prenatal Screening Items**: In addition to routine examinations, pay attention to blood type antibody titer testing. In addition, timely prenatal checkups, including Down syndrome screening and fetal anatomy scan, should be performed to assess fetal development.\n\n### III. Neonatal Observation and Care\n\n* **Jaundice Observation**: After birth, closely monitor jaundice. Neonatal hemolytic disease may cause jaundice to appear earlier and be more severe. If jaundice appears too early (e.g., within 24 hours), rises rapidly, is severe, or persists, seek medical care immediately.\n* **Daily Care**: Keep the baby's skin clean and warm. Try to start breastfeeding as early as possible, encourage the baby to breastfeed to promote meconium passage, which can help alleviate jaundice.\n\n### IV. Nutritional Supplementation and Psychological Adjustment\n\n* **Nutritional Supplementation**: Ensure balanced intake of protein, vitamins, minerals, etc., such as lean meat, vegetables, and fruits.\n* **Psychological Adjustment**: Maintain a good mindset, avoid anxiety and stress. Engaging in light exercise, listening to music, etc., can help alleviate prenatal stress.\n\n### V. Special Case Management\n\n* **Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation**: Although this is rare, if an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is performed and successful, the patient's blood type may become that of the donor. Close monitoring of blood type changes and related health issues is required.\n\nIn summary, when the husband is blood type A and wife is type O, there are considerations for blood type inheritance and neonatal hemolytic disease, prenatal care and examinations, neonatal observation and care, and nutritional supplementation and psychological adjustment, as well as management of special cases.",

      "answer_en": "Moderate consumption of cherries by individuals with elevated blood glucose typically does not cause adverse reactions and may provide a variety of nutrients. Cherries are a low-calorie, nutrient-dense fruit, rich in protein, sugars, phosphorus, carotenoids, vitamins C and E, potassium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and other trace elements. The following is a detailed analysis of cherries consumption in patients with hyperglycemia:\n\n### Nutritional Value of Cherries\n\n* **Low glycemic index**: The glycemic index of cherries is 22, which is relatively low for fruits.\n* **Moderate sugar content**: The sugar content of cherries is about 10 g per 100 g; moderate consumption will not cause large fluctuations in blood glucose.\n* **Rich in dietary fiber**: The dietary fiber in cherries helps promote intestinal peristalsis, increase satiety, regulate blood glucose and cholesterol levels, and support intestinal health.\n* **Contains antioxidants**: Cherries are rich in antioxidants such as anthocyanins and carotenoids, which can protect the body from damage caused by free radicals.\n* **Iron-rich**: The iron content of cherries is among the highest of fruits; moderate consumption can replenish iron and prevent and treat iron-deficiency anemia.\n\n### Precautions for Patients with Elevated Blood Glucose When Eating Cherries\n\n* **Control intake**: Patients with fasting blood glucose below 7.8 mmol/L and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose below 10 mmol/L may eat cherries in moderation. The recommended daily intake is about 50 g, roughly equivalent to 10 fresh cherries.\n* **Timing**: It is best to eat cherries between meals, around 10:00 a.m. or around 3:00 p.m., avoiding eating cherries immediately before or after meals to prevent large swings in blood glucose.\n* **How to eat**: Rinse cherries and eat them directly, avoid juicing them or making jams with added white sugar, to prevent blood glucose elevation.\n\n### Possible Adverse Reactions\n\n* **Gastrointestinal discomfort**: If cherries are eaten in excess at one time, individuals with high blood glucose may experience bloating, abdominal pain, and other GI discomfort.\n* **Blood glucose elevation**: When blood glucose fluctuates greatly or remains at a high level, consuming a large amount of cherries may further raise blood glucose and worsen the condition.\n\nIn general, individuals with elevated blood glucose can eat cherries in moderation, but they should pay attention to controlling intake and eating time to avoid adverse reactions caused by overconsumption and improper eating methods. At the same time, if there is noticeable fluctuation in blood glucose or other discomfort after eating cherries, one should promptly adjust the amount consumed or pause consumption, and manage diet and blood glucose under a doctor's guidance.",
      "difficulty_en": "central",
      "checklist_en": "Core requirements:\n1. Content requirements: The glycemic index and sugar content of cherries are relatively low, and moderate consumption generally does not cause adverse reactions in people with hyperglycemia, but intake should be controlled.\n2. Content requirements: Provide precautions for consuming cherries, such as recommended daily intake, best time to eat and method of consumption, to avoid blood glucose fluctuations.\n\nSecondary requirements:\n1. Explain possible adverse reactions, such as gastrointestinal discomfort and the risk of elevated blood glucose with excessive consumption.\n2. Emphasize that after consuming cherries, if there are blood glucose fluctuations or discomfort, one should adjust the amount or pause, and consult a doctor."

      "answer_en": "The rare clinical manifestations of primary aldosteronism mainly include the following aspects:\n\n### I. Sudden death due to severe arrhythmias\n\n* Although arrhythmias are relatively common in patients with primary aldosteronism, cases severe enough to cause sudden death are relatively rare. This may be due to long-standing uncontrolled hypertension and hypokalemia causing serious damage to the heart, thereby triggering fatal arrhythmias.\n\n### II. Chronic kidney disease\n\n* This is caused by long-standing tubular lesions with secondary glomerular and interstitial changes, and is relatively rare in patients with primary aldosteronism.\n\n* Chronic kidney disease may lead the patient to a range of serious clinical symptoms, such as anemia, edema, and uncontrolled hypertension, severely affecting the patient’s quality of life.\n\n### III. Severe neuromuscular dysfunction\n\n* Such as dyspnea, dysphagia, etc.; these symptoms may occur in patients with severe disease, but are relatively rare.\n\n* This may be due to long-standing hypokalemia reducing neuromuscular excitability, thereby causing severe neuromuscular dysfunction.\n\n### IV. Growth and development disorders (primarily in pediatric patients)\n\n* Although this symptom is relatively rare in adult PA patients, it may occur in pediatric patients.\n\n* This may be related to long-standing potassium deficiency and other metabolic disturbances; with hypokalemia, insulin release is reduced and its action weakened, which can lead to impaired glucose tolerance and thus affect children’s growth and development.\n\nIt should be noted that due to the etiologies and pathophysiological mechanisms of PA being complex and diverse, there are individual differences in its clinical presentation. Therefore, when diagnosing PA, one should comprehensively consider the patient’s symptoms, signs, and laboratory test results, among other factors.

      "answer_en": "### I. Overview of Cost Range\n\n* Generally speaking, the price of an appendectomy in Guangzhou typically ranges from 2,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, and may even exceed 10,000 yuan.\n\n### II. Main Factors Affecting Costs\n\n1. Severity of the condition:\n\n* Uncomplicated appendicitis: the condition is relatively mild and without complications; surgical costs are relatively low.\n\n* Suppurative or perforated appendicitis: the condition is more complex, requiring general anesthesia and more complex surgical techniques; costs are higher.\n\n2. Surgical approach:\n\n* Traditional open surgery: costs are relatively low, generally between 5,000 yuan and 8,000 yuan. This method is technically mature, but the incision is larger and postoperative recovery is longer.\n\n* Laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery: costs are relatively higher, usually between 8,000 yuan and 12,000 yuan. This method has less trauma and faster recovery, but requires higher technical skill from the surgeon.\n\n* Single-incision laparoscopic surgery: costs are even higher, generally between 10,000 yuan and 15,000 yuan. This method uses only one small incision in the abdomen for the operation, with less trauma and better cosmetic results, but greater technical difficulty.\n\n3. Hospital grade:\n\n* Different levels of hospitals have different charging standards; generally, large public Grade 3A hospitals have relatively higher costs.\n\n4. Postoperative care and complications:\n\n* Postoperative care and whether complications occur also affect the total cost. If recovery is smooth and no complications occur, costs are relatively low.\n\n### III. Notes\n\n* The above costs are for reference only; actual costs should be determined based on the patient's specific condition and the charging standards of the chosen hospital.\n\n* If there is medical insurance, part of the costs can be reimbursed; for the specific reimbursement rate, please consult the local hospital’s medical insurance department.\n\nIn summary, the cost of undergoing appendectomy in Guangzhou varies due to multiple factors. Patients are advised to seek timely medical consultation, choose a hospital and surgical method appropriate to their actual situation, and consult with doctors to obtain accurate cost information.",

      "answer_en": "Generally, the time to complete recovery after an appendectomy varies due to multiple factors such as the surgical method, severity of the condition, patient age, and physical constitution. The following are detailed answers regarding recovery time and precautions:\n\n### I. Recovery Time\n\n1. **Initial Recovery**：\n\n* About seven days after surgery, the patient can usually have the sutures removed; at this time the wound is initially healing, and the functions of eating and expelling gas and stool gradually return to normal, marking the completion of initial recovery.\n\n2. **Complete Recovery**：\n\n* For most patients, complete recovery may take about 2-3 weeks. However, this time frame is not absolute and depends on individual differences and postoperative care.\n* If traditional open appendectomy is performed, due to greater trauma, the postoperative recovery time may be relatively longer, and complete recovery may take 3-4 weeks.\n* Laparoscopic appendectomy has the advantages of less trauma and faster recovery; patients can usually achieve complete recovery within 2-3 weeks.\n\n### II. Precautions\n\n1. **Wound Care**：\n\n* In the early postoperative period, patients should pay attention to wound care, with regular disinfection and dressing changes to prevent infection.\n* Keep the wound clean and dry, avoid getting it wet, and regularly change dressings.\n\n2. **Dietary Adjustments**：\n\n* In the early postoperative period, patients should temporarily withhold fluids, and gradually resume a diet once bowel peristalsis has returned.\n* The diet should transition from liquids and semiliquids to normal diet, avoiding spicy, greasy, and irritating foods to prevent increasing gastrointestinal burden.\n* Eat more nutrient-rich fresh vegetables, fruits, and high-protein foods such as fish and meat to promote recovery.\n\n3. **Moderate Exercise**：\n\n* In the early postoperative period, avoid strenuous exercise to prevent unnecessary stress on the wound.\n* As the wound gradually heals and the body condition improves, patients can gradually increase activity under a doctor’s guidance, such as slow walking or simple stretching exercises.\n\n4. **Avoid Fatigue**：\n\n* Postoperative patients should ensure adequate rest and sleep, avoid staying up late and overexertion.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-Up**：\n\n* Follow the doctor's instructions for regular follow-ups so the physician can timely understand the recovery status and adjust the treatment plan.\n\n6. **Watch for Complications**：\n\n* If complications such as incision infection or intra-abdominal adhesions occur, seek medical attention promptly.\n\nIn summary, the time for complete recovery after appendectomy varies by individual differences, but is generally around 2-3 weeks. During recovery, patients should pay attention to wound care, dietary adjustments, moderate exercise, avoiding fatigue, and regular follow-ups to promote early rehabilitation.",

Whether surgery is needed and the magnitude of surgical risk depend on the lump’s nature, size, the patient’s physical condition, and other factors. The following is a detailed analysis of these two questions:\n\n### Whether surgery is needed\n\n- **Benign lump**:\n- **Observation and management**: For small and asymptomatic benign lumps, such as breast hyperplasia or breast fibroadenoma, immediate surgery may not be necessary. The doctor may recommend regular observation, monitoring changes in the lump with breast ultrasound or mammography, etc.\n- **Surgical treatment**: If the lump is large, growing rapidly, or has obvious symptoms such as pain or compression of surrounding tissues, the doctor may suggest surgical excision. For multiple lipomas, a single large lesion can be considered for surgical removal.\n\n- **Malignant lump**:\n- **Surgical treatment**: If the lump is diagnosed as malignant, such as breast cancer, surgery is usually required. The surgical approach will be determined by the lump’s size, location, and the patient’s condition, and may include breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) or modified radical mastectomy, etc.\n- **Combined therapy**: In addition to surgery, treatment for malignant lumps may also include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, endocrine therapy, etc.\n\n### Are there risks of surgery\n\n- **Surgical risks**: Any surgery carries certain risks, and excision of a chest wall lump is no exception. But chest wall lump excision is relatively not a large surgery, with relatively small risks. Risks may include incision infection, bleeding, nerve injury, etc.\n- **Risk control**: Choosing a reputable hospital and an experienced surgeon can greatly reduce surgical risk. A legitimate hospital provides safety assurances; the doctor will formulate a personalized surgical plan based on the patient’s specific situation and minimize the risk.\n\nIn summary, whether surgery is needed and the magnitude of surgical risk depend on the patient’s specific situation. It is recommended that the patient seek medical care promptly, communicate fully with the doctor, and understand the lump’s nature and treatment options to make an informed decision.

      "answer_en": "The costs of open surgical removal of a chest mass can be reimbursed by medical insurance if they meet the relevant regulations. The following is a detailed explanation of medical insurance reimbursement:\n\n### Basic Conditions for Medical Insurance Reimbursement\n\nAccording to the relevant provisions of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Social Insurance, medical expenses that conform to the Basic Medical Insurance Drug Catalog, diagnostic and treatment items, standards for medical service facilities, as well as emergencies and resuscitation, can be paid from the Basic Medical Insurance Fund in accordance with national regulations. Therefore, if the chest mass removal surgery meets the above conditions, it can theoretically be reimbursed.\n\n### Scope and Limitations of Medical Insurance Reimbursement\n\n* **Reimbursement scope**: typically, medical insurance reimbursement covers inpatient medical expenses, outpatient medical expenses, and costs for certain drugs, etc. The chest mass removal surgery generally falls within the scope of inpatient medical expenses, but the exact coverage needs to be determined according to the surgical method and hospital regulations.\n* **Reimbursement limitations**: certain medical expenses are not included in the Basic Medical Insurance Fund for payment under specific circumstances, such as those to be paid from the Work-Related Injury Insurance Fund, those to be borne by a third party, those covered by public health burdens, and expenses for medical treatment abroad. If the costs of chest mass removal fall into any of these situations, reimbursement by medical insurance will not be available.\n\n### Reimbursement Rate and Process\n\n* **Reimbursement rate**: the specific reimbursement rate varies by region, type of medical insurance, hospital grade, as well as the drugs and equipment used during the procedure. Generally, inpatient surgical costs have a higher reimbursement rate, but the exact rate is determined by local medical insurance policies.\n* **Reimbursement process**: after the surgery, the patient should prepare documents such as ID card, social security card, and inpatient medical records, and go to the social security administration department, designated medical institutions, or pharmacies to process the reimbursement. Expenses incurred within the scope defined by the medical insurance drug catalog and diagnostic/treatment items can receive medical coverage according to the established proportion.\n\n### Notes\n\n* When choosing where to seek medical care, patients should consider factors related to medical insurance reimbursement. Reimbursement for treatment received out of area may be lower than local treatment.\n* Drugs, materials, and other items used during the surgery should conform to the medical insurance catalog; otherwise reimbursement may not be available.\n* Patients should consult the hospital or local medical insurance department before surgery to clearly understand the surgical costs and the specific policies and procedures for medical insurance reimbursement, so as to better plan the surgery and the reimbursement process.\n\nIn summary, the costs of open surgical removal of a chest mass can be reimbursed by medical insurance if they meet the relevant regulations, but the specific scope of reimbursement and rate depend on local medical insurance policies and regulations.",

      "problem": "拔除双J管的步骤？",
      "groupCode": 121,
      "sanswer": "拔除双J管的步骤一般包括以下内容：\n\n### 一、术前准备\n\n1. **检查**：在拔双J管之前，首先应该做相应的检查，包括心电图、血液分析、尿液分析、传染病八项、以及肝功肾功血糖等情况，做一个初步的判断是否能够耐受膀胱镜检查，因为取双J管需要在膀胱镜下操作。此外，还会通过影像学手段（如B超、X光或CT）确认输尿管支架管的位置是否在位，以及是否通畅。\n2. **消毒**：对患者的会阴区域进行消毒处理，以避免在手术过程中发生感染。\n3. **麻醉**：根据患者的具体情况和医生的判断，可能需要在麻醉下进行取管操作。麻醉方式可以是局部麻醉或全身麻醉。\n4. **体位**：让患者采取截石位，即仰卧，双腿屈曲并向外展开，以便于医生操作。\n\n### 二、拔除操作\n\n1. **进镜**：在麻醉生效后，医生会使用膀胱镜或输尿管镜从尿道外口进入膀胱。\n2. **拔管**：在膀胱镜或输尿管镜的直视下，找到输尿管支架管的末端，用取石钳夹住输尿管支架管，然后连同膀胱镜或输尿管镜一起缓慢拔出体外。如果双J管发生移动，进入输尿管内，膀胱镜没有发现双J管，可以将输尿管镜经尿道进入膀胱，找到相应的输尿管管口，之后继续上行寻找双J管，找到之后连同输尿管镜一并缓慢取出。\n\n### 三、术后恢复与护理\n\n1. **多喝水**：术后应多喝水，以增加尿量，促进体内代谢产物的排出，预防尿路感染。\n2. **饮食调整**：避免食用高盐、辛辣、油腻等刺激性大的食物，不喝酒，以免加重肾脏负担或影响伤口愈合。可以多吃一些清淡易消化的食物，如新鲜的水果和蔬菜。\n3. **休息与运动**：术后应注意休息，避免进行剧烈运动，以免导致伤口开裂或加重肾脏负担。但适当的运动也是必要的，可以促进血液循环和结石的排出。\n4. **药物**：拔除双J管后，需要服用三天抗生素，以控制感染。如果出现疼痛、血尿、尿频尿急尿痛等不适症状，可以在医生的指导下口服盐酸左氧氟沙星胶囊、甲硝唑片、头孢氨苄胶囊等药物进行治疗，能够起到消炎的作用。\n5. **定期复查**：术后应遵医嘱定期复查，观察肾脏的恢复情况，以及是否有结石复发或其他异常情况。\n\n总的来说，拔除双J管是一个相对简单但需要精细操作的过程，患者需要在医生的指导下进行，并遵循医嘱进行术后恢复和护理。",

      "problem_en": "What are the steps for removing a double-J stent?",
      "answer_en": "### I. Preoperative Preparation\n\n1. **Examinations**: Before removing the Double-J stent, appropriate examinations should be performed, including electrocardiography, blood tests, urinalysis, the eight infectious disease markers, and liver and renal function tests, as well as blood glucose, to make a preliminary assessment of whether the patient can tolerate cystoscopy, since removal of the Double-J stent requires cystoscopic manipulation. Additionally, imaging studies (such as ultrasound, X-ray, or CT) will confirm whether the ureteral stent is in place and whether it is patent.\n\n2. **Disinfection**: Disinfect the patient’s perineal region to prevent infection during the procedure.\n\n3. **Anesthesia**: Depending on the patient's condition and the physician's judgment, the removal may be performed under anesthesia. Anesthesia can be local or general.\n\n4. **Positioning**: Have the patient in the lithotomy position, i.e., supine with the hips and knees flexed and legs abducted, to facilitate the physician's operation.\n\n### II. Removal Procedure\n\n1. **Scope Insertion**: After anesthesia takes effect, the physician will insert a cystoscope or ureteroscope through the external urethral meatus into the bladder.\n\n2. **Stent Removal**: Under direct visualization with the cystoscope or ureteroscope, locate the distal end of the ureteral stent, grasp it with a stone-grasping forceps, and then, together with the cystoscope or ureteroscope, slowly withdraw it externally. If the Double-J stent migrates into the ureter and is not visible with the cystoscope, advance the ureteroscope through the urethra into the bladder, locate the corresponding ureteral orifice, then continue to ascend to locate the Double-J stent, and remove it slowly together with the ureteroscope.\n\n### III. Postoperative Recovery and Care\n\n1. **Hydration**: After surgery, drink plenty of water to increase urine output, promote the elimination of metabolic products, and prevent urinary tract infection.\n\n2. **Dietary Adjustments**: Avoid high-salt, spicy, greasy, and other irritating foods, and do not drink alcohol to prevent increased burden on the kidneys or impede wound healing. You can eat more bland, easily digestible foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n3. **Rest and Activity**: After surgery, rest and avoid vigorous exercise to prevent wound dehiscence or increased kidney burden. However, moderate activity is beneficial and can promote blood circulation and stone clearance.\n\n4. **Medications**: After removal of the Double-J stent, antibiotics should be taken for three days to control infection. If you experience pain, hematuria, urinary frequency/urgency/dysuria, you can, under medical guidance, take medications such as Levofloxacin hydrochloride capsules, Metronidazole tablets, cephalexin capsules, etc., which can have anti-inflammatory effects.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-Up**: Postoperative follow-up should be conducted as advised by the physician to monitor renal recovery and whether there is recurrence of stones or other abnormalities.\n\nIn summary, removal of the Double-J stent is a relatively simple but technically demanding procedure; patients should undergo it under the guidance of a physician and follow the postoperative instructions for recovery and care.",

      "answer_en": "After removal of the double-J stent, the patient should pay attention to the following:\n\n### Precautions\n\n1. **Keep the urethral opening clean**: After stent removal, pay special attention to the cleanliness and hygiene of the urethral opening to prevent infection.\n2. **Increase fluid intake**: Drinking more water helps flush the urethra, prevent urinary tract infections, and may promote stone expulsion. The recommended daily water intake should reach 2000-3000ml.\n3. **Moderate exercise**: For a period after stent removal, avoid vigorous exercise to prevent affecting wound healing or causing hematuria. However, light activities such as walking or brisk walking are acceptable. Strenuous exercise should be undertaken about one month after the removal of the double-J stent.\n4. **Dietary adjustments**: The diet should be light and easily digestible, avoid spicy, fatty, and other irritating foods, and maintain regular bowel movements.\n5. **Seek medical attention promptly**: If fever, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, flank or abdominal pain, etc., occur, seek medical care promptly to rule out complications or manage potential issues.\n6. **Avoid sexual activity**: During the recovery period after stent removal, to avoid affecting wound healing, sexual activity should be temporarily avoided. The exact time to resume sexual activity should be determined by the doctor's advice and individual recovery.\n7. **Regular follow-up**: After removal of the double-J stent, regular follow-ups are recommended, such as a urinary tract color Doppler ultrasound, to determine whether stones have recurred and whether hydronephrosis has worsened.\n\n### Adverse Reactions\n\nAfter removal of the double-J stent, patients may experience some adverse reactions, mainly including:\n\n1. **Hematuria**: During stent removal, the urethra may suffer some injury, leading to hematuria. This hematuria usually does not require special treatment and may disappear on its own within about two days. If hematuria is significant or accompanied by blood clots, oral hemostatic medications may be needed.\n2. **Urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria**: These symptoms may be caused by cystoscopic manipulation irritating the bladder mucosa or by the double-J stent irritating the urethra.\n3. **Low back discomfort or pain**: Some patients may experience low back discomfort or pain after removal due to stones, ureteral stricture, or friction between the double-J stent and the ureter. Additionally, if hydronephrosis develops after removal, it may also cause back pain.\n4. **Infection**: Bacteria may be introduced during stent removal or infections may develop while the catheter is in place. Symptoms may include fever, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, etc. To prevent infection, the physician may recommend short-term antibiotic therapy after removal and maintaining personal hygiene.\n\nIn summary, after removal of the double-J stent, patients should closely monitor their condition and seek medical consultation promptly if any discomfort or abnormal symptoms occur. At the same time, follow the doctor's recommendations for necessary care and follow-up to promote a rapid recovery.",

      "problem_en": "What are the risks associated with facial contouring plastic surgery?",
      "answer_en": "Facial contouring surgery is a complex and meticulous procedure that involves adjusting the facial bones and soft tissues to improve the contour and shape of the face. However, this surgery also carries certain risks. The following are some risks that facial contouring surgery may face:\n\n### I. Surgical complications\n\n1. **Bleeding**: During the procedure, vessels may be damaged, leading to bleeding. Minor bleeding can usually stop on its own, but significant bleeding may require emergency intervention to prevent shock.\n\n2. **Infection**: Inadequate aseptic technique during the procedure or improper wound care postoperatively may allow bacteria to enter the wound, causing infection. Common symptoms include redness, swelling, pain, fever, and purulent discharge; in severe cases, lymphadenitis or signs of systemic infection may occur.\n\n3. **Nerve injury**: The facial nerve is abundant and its course is variable; during surgery, nerves may be injured, causing corresponding manifestations such as inability to raise the eyebrow, disappearance of the nasolabial fold on one side, mouth deviation on opening, sensory disturbances, etc. Recovery from nerve injury is often prolonged, and in some cases may not fully recover.\n\n4. **Facial asymmetry**: Unequal amounts of tissue removal or differences in incision position between sides may lead to asymmetry of the face left and right after surgery. This is generally correctable with revision surgery.\n\n### II. Risks related to surgical outcomes\n\n1. **Dissatisfaction with results**: Because each person’s facial contour and expected results differ, the surgical outcome may not fully meet the patient’s expectations, leading to dissatisfaction with the results.\n\n2. **Overcorrection or undercorrection**: During surgery, overcorrection or undercorrection of the facial contour may occur due to the surgeon’s judgment or technique, affecting aesthetics.\n\n### III. Long-term risks\n\n1. **Hypertrophic scarring**: The surgical incisions may develop hypertrophic scars during healing, affecting aesthetics. Excessive scar growth may lead to darkening of color and a harder texture.\n\n2. **Facial stiffness**: The surgery may damage facial muscles or nerves, causing the facial expression to become stiff or unnatural.\n\n3. **Soft tissue ptosis**: Over time, facial soft tissues may sag due to surgical trauma or natural aging, affecting the outcome of the procedure.\n\n### IV. Other risks\n\n1. **Anesthesia risks**: The procedure usually requires general anesthesia, and anesthesia may carry risks such as respiratory depression or cardiac arrest.\n\n2. **Psychological risks**: Surgical failure or unsatisfactory results may cause psychological stress and anxiety.\n\n### V. Recommendations to reduce risks\n\n1. **Choose reputable institutions**: Select medical institutions and physicians with proper qualifications and rich experience for the procedure.\n\n2. **Thorough communication**: Before surgery, communicate fully with the physician to understand the risks, outcomes, and recovery timeline, and to clarify your expectations and needs.\n\n3. **Postoperative care**: Strictly follow postoperative instructions and follow-up appointments to promptly detect and manage complications.\n\nIn summary, while facial contouring surgery can improve facial contour and morphology, it also carries certain risks. Patients should fully understand these risks when considering the procedure and make informed decisions under the guidance of their doctor.",

      "answer_en": "### 1. Operational Risks\n\n* **Nerve Injury**: If not performed properly, the RF plasma needle knife may injure nerves surrounding the treatment area, leading to nerve dysfunction, such as sensory disturbances, motor impairment, etc.\n* **Vascular Injury**: During treatment, if blood vessels are inadvertently damaged, it may cause bleeding, hematoma, and other complications.\n* **Infection**: If the treatment instruments are not thoroughly sterilized or postoperative care is inadequate, infection may occur.\n\n### 2. Treatment-Related Complications\n\n* **Localized Pain**: After treatment, some patients may experience localized pain at the treatment area, usually due to inflammatory responses triggered by tissue injury.\n* **Swelling**: After treatment, the treatment area may swell, caused by congestion and edema reactions in response to local tissue stimulation.\n* **Numbness**: Some patients may experience numbness in the treatment area, which may be due to nerve stimulation or injury.\n\n### 3. Long-Term Effects\n\n* **Tissue Adhesions**: During treatment, if tissue injury is severe or postoperative care is inadequate, adhesions may occur, affecting treatment outcomes and the patient’s quality of life.\n* **Recurrence**: For certain conditions, such as disc herniation, there is a risk of recurrence after RF plasma needle knife treatment. This may be due to re-injury or stimulation of the diseased site, or incomplete treatment.\n\n### 4. Individual Variation\n\n* **Individual Differences**: Factors such as the patient’s physical condition, disease severity, and response to treatment can influence the effectiveness and hazards of RF plasma needle knife treatment. Therefore, before treatment, clinicians should conduct a comprehensive assessment of the patient and formulate a personalized treatment plan.\n\n### 5. Preventive Measures\n\n* **Strict Aseptic Technique**: Ensure thorough disinfection of treatment instruments to prevent infection.\n* **Precise Operation**: Physicians need to be proficient in the operation techniques of the RF plasma needle knife, ensuring precision and safety during the treatment.\n* **Postoperative Care**: Strengthen postoperative care, such as regular dressing changes and keeping the wound clean and dry, to promote wound healing and reduce the occurrence of complications.\n\n### 6.

      "problem": "胎盘为什么会出现血窦？如果增大严重吗？",
      "groupCode": 133,
      "sanswer": "胎盘出现血窦可能由多种原因引起，以下是一些主要的原因：\n\n1. **胎盘发育异常**：在胎盘形成的过程中，如果结构发育不完善，可能导致局部血管形成血窦。这可能与先天性血管发育畸形有关，例如血管扭曲等。\n2. **孕妇血管病变**：如妊娠期高血压疾病，会影响胎盘的血液循环，增加血窦形成的风险。持续性血压高会造成胎盘部位血管痉挛，严重的情况下会引发胎盘早剥，导致胎盘血窦出现。\n3. **外力损伤**：孕妇腹部受到撞击或挤压等外力作用，可能损伤胎盘血管，形成血窦。\n4. **感染**：孕妇发生胎盘部位的感染，炎症刺激可影响血管，造成血窦。\n5. **孕妇自身的血液系统疾病**：像血小板减少性紫癜、再生障碍性贫血等，会影响凝血功能，易导致胎盘血窦。\n6. **子宫内膜损伤**：如果孕妇在怀孕期间进行了人工流产手术或者刮宫术等，则可能会导致子宫内膜受到损伤，从而引起胎盘血窦形成的症状。\n7. **宫腔粘连**：如果孕妇存在宫腔粘连的情况，在宫腔粘连的部位会出现纤维组织增生的现象，从而影响到正常的血液循环，也会出现上述情况。\n8. **药物因素**：如果孕妇长期服用避孕药或者是紧急避孕药，也会影响到体内激素水平的变化，从而导致胎盘血窦形成。\n9. **遗传因素**：若家族中有类似疾病的患者，其后代患病风险相对较高。\n\n关于胎盘血窦增大的问题，以下是一些相关信息：\n\n1. **胎盘血窦的大小评估**：超声诊断标准为二维切面上胎盘内局灶性流动性低回区，直径＞2*2cm。一般来说，较小的胎盘血窦（通常小于3cm）对孕妇和胎儿一般无较大影响，只需定期复查即可。然而，当胎盘血窦大于5cm时，通常被认为属于严重情况，可能会对胎儿或孕妇造成危险。\n2. **胎盘血窦增大的影响**：如果胎盘血窦逐渐增大，可能会增加出血的风险。特别是在分娩过程中，如果血窦破裂，可能导致大出血，危及孕妇生命。同时，由于宫缩乏力，可能导致胎儿出现宫内窘迫，甚至胎死宫内。\n3. **胎盘血窦的处理**：如果产检发现胎盘血窦，并且血窦较大或有出血风险，孕妇需要密切关注临床症状，并在医生指导下进行保胎和止血治疗。此外，孕妇应避免剧烈活动，尽量卧床休息，以减少出血风险。在分娩方式的选择上，如果血窦较大，可能不建议顺产，而需要考虑剖宫产等安全的分娩方式。\n\n综上所述，胎盘出现血窦的原因较为复杂，可能与多种因素有关。而胎盘血窦的增大是否严重，则取决于其大小、增长速度以及孕妇和胎儿的具体情况。因此，孕妇在孕期应定期产检，及时发现和处理相关问题。",

      "problem_en": "Why do placental sinusoids occur? If they enlarge, is that serious?",
      "answer_en": "Placental sinusoids may arise from multiple causes; the following are some major reasons:\n\n1. **Abnormal placental development**: During placental formation, if the structural development is incomplete, it may lead to local vessels forming sinusoids. This may be related to congenital vascular malformations, such as vascular tortuosity.\n2. **Maternal vascular disease**: For example, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can affect placental blood flow, increasing the risk of sinusoid formation. Persistent hypertension can cause vasospasm at the placental site, and in severe cases can trigger placental abruption, leading to placental sinusoids.\n3. **External trauma**: Abdominal impact or compression during pregnancy may injure placental vessels, forming sinusoids.\n4. **Infection**: Infections at the placental site can provoke inflammatory stimulation that affects vessels, leading to sinusoids.\n5. **Maternal hematologic disorders**: Conditions such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, aplastic anemia, etc., affect coagulation and predispose to placental sinusoids.\n6. **Endometrial injury**: If artificial abortion procedures or curettage were performed during pregnancy, the endometrium may be damaged, thereby causing placental sinusoids.\n7. **Intrauterine adhesions**: If intrauterine adhesions are present, fibrous tissue proliferation occurs at adhesion sites, affecting normal blood circulation and also leading to the above conditions.\n8. **Medication factors**: Long-term use of oral contraceptives or emergency contraception can influence hormonal levels, thereby leading to placental sinusoids.\n9. **Genetic factors**: If there is a family history of similar diseases, offspring risk is relatively higher.\n\nRegarding the issue of placental sinusoid enlargement, the following information is relevant:\n\n1. **Assessment of placental sinusoid size**: Ultrasound diagnostic criteria are a focal hypoechoic region within the placenta on a two-dimensional plane, with a diameter > 2 × 2 cm. Generally, smaller placental sinusoids (usually less than 3 cm) have little impact on the mother and fetus, and only regular follow-up is needed. However, when placental sinusoids exceed 5 cm, this is usually regarded as a severe condition that may pose danger to the fetus or the mother.\n2. **Impact of placental sinusoid enlargement**: If placental sinusoids gradually enlarge, the risk of bleeding may increase. Especially during delivery, if a sinusoid ruptures, massive bleeding can occur, endangering the mother’s life. At the same time, due to uterine atony, the fetus may experience intrapartum distress, and even intrauterine fetal death.\n3. **Management of placental sinusoid**: If prenatal examination detects placental sinusoids, and the sinusoids are large or there is a bleeding risk, the pregnant woman should closely monitor clinical symptoms and, under medical supervision, undergo pregnancy-preserving and hemostatic treatment. In addition, she should avoid strenuous activity and rest in bed as much as possible to reduce the risk of bleeding. In terms of delivery mode, if the sinusoids are large, vaginal delivery may not be recommended, and safer delivery options such as cesarean section should be considered.\n\nIn summary, the appearance of placental sinusoids has complex causes and may be related to multiple factors. Whether enlargement of placental sinusoids is serious depends on its size, growth rate, and the specific circumstances of the mother and fetus. Therefore, during pregnancy, women should undergo regular prenatal checkups to promptly identify and address related problems.",

      "answer_en": "For hydatidiform mole with arrested embryonic development, after an abortion procedure, whether physical therapy is required mainly depends on the patient’s individual circumstances and the physician’s professional judgment. The following is a detailed analysis of this issue:\n\n### 1. Application of physical therapy after abortion procedure\n\n* **General situation**: Generally, physical therapy is not required after abortion procedures. Doctors may recommend oral medications or intravenous fluids to prevent infection and promote recovery.\n* **Specific situations**: However, if the patient has special circumstances, such as poor uterine involution, prolonged bleeding, or infection risk, doctors may recommend physical therapy. Physical therapy can help promote blood circulation, reduce inflammation and infection risk, and aid better uterine repair.\n\n### 2. Methods of physical therapy\n\n* **Microwave therapy**: This is a commonly used physical therapy method, which can promote uterine contractions by irradiating deep tissues, accelerate the expulsion of residual material from the uterine cavity, and reduce the likelihood of pelvic infection.\n* **Other physical therapies**: These include hot compress, electromagnetic therapy, infrared irradiation, etc., which can, to varying degrees, promote uterine recovery and reduce inflammation.\n\n### 3. Recommendations on whether to undergo physical therapy\n\n* **Consult a doctor**: Patients should consult their doctor after the procedure to understand whether physical therapy is needed given their specific situation.\n* **Comprehensive consideration**: The doctor will consider factors such as the patient’s age, physical condition, and surgical situation to provide the most suitable treatment recommendations.\n\n### 4. Postoperative precautions\n\n* **Rest and nutrition**: Regardless of whether physical therapy is performed, patients should pay attention to rest and a nutritious diet to promote recovery.\n* **Avoid sexual intercourse**: For a period after surgery, sexual intercourse should be avoided to reduce infection risk.\n* **Regular follow-up**: Under the doctor’s guidance, perform regular follow-up examinations to ensure recovery and promptly detect and manage any complications.\n\nIn summary, for patients who have undergone abortion for hydatidiform mole with arrested embryonic development, whether to receive physical therapy should be determined by the patient’s individual situation and the physician’s recommendations.

      "answer_en": "### 1. Risk of becoming pregnant again after a hydatidiform mole\n\n* **There is a risk**: Women with a history of hydatidiform mole indeed have a higher risk of hydatidiform mole in subsequent pregnancies compared with the general population. According to incomplete statistics, for women with a prior hydatidiform mole, the chance of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy is about 1%; if there is a history of two prior molar pregnancies, the recurrence rate rises to 15%–20%.\n* **Individual variation**: However, this does not mean that all women with a history of hydatidiform mole will develop a hydatidiform mole again in every subsequent pregnancy. Each person's physical condition and reproductive environment are unique, so there are individual differences.\n\n### 2. Causes of hydatidiform mole recurrence\n\n* **Genetic factors**: The occurrence of hydatidiform mole may be related to genetics.\n* **Endocrine disorders**: Endocrine disorders are also one of the reasons for recurrence. In hydatidiform mole, endocrine hormones change, and the levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) rise markedly.\n* **Malnutrition**: Malnutrition is also related to the formation and recurrence of hydatidiform mole. For example, folate deficiency may be related to the occurrence of hydatidiform mole.\n* **Postoperative recovery**: The recovery after a hydatidiform mole also influences recurrence. If pregnancy occurs soon after the procedure or if recovery is poor, it may increase the risk of recurrence.\n\n### 3. How to reduce the risk of recurrence\n\n* **Standardized treatment**: After the initial hydatidiform mole, one should receive standardized treatment and follow-up to ensure the disease is fully controlled.\n* **Healthy lifestyle**: Maintain a healthy lifestyle and dietary habits to avoid malnutrition and endocrine disorders.\n* **Regular follow-up**: After molar treatment, strictly follow the physician's advice for follow-up, closely monitor serum hCG levels and other indicators, and only after they have normalized for a period of time can pregnancy be considered again.\n* **Comprehensive evaluation**: Before trying to conceive again, perform a comprehensive physical examination and assessment, including gynecological examination, ultrasound, endocrine tests, etc., to understand uterine recovery and screen for potential issues.\n\n### 4. Precautions after conceiving again\n\n* **Seek medical care promptly**: As soon as you become pregnant again, seek medical care and inform the doctor of your hydatidiform mole history.\n* **Regular monitoring**: During pregnancy, conduct regular prenatal examinations and monitoring to detect abnormalities early and take appropriate measures.\n\nIn summary, women with a history of hydatidiform mole do indeed face a risk of recurrence when conceiving again, but this risk varies by individual. Through standardized treatment, a healthy lifestyle, and regular follow-up, the risk of recurrence can be minimized as much as possible. At the same time, after conceiving again, seek medical care promptly and undergo regular examinations to ensure maternal and fetal safety.",

      "sanswer": "打完骨膜封闭后，其效果持续时间以及可能产生的不良影响因人而异，以下是一些常见情况：\n\n### 效果持续时间\n- **疼痛缓解方面**\n- 对于一些病情较轻、病程较短的患者，如因轻度劳损或外伤引起的局部骨膜炎症，打完骨膜封闭后，疼痛缓解效果通常可以持续数周甚至数月。比如一些单纯的手腕部腱鞘炎患者，经过一次骨膜封闭治疗后，疼痛可能在1-2周内明显减轻，效果可持续2-3个月左右。\n- 若是病情较重，如严重的骨关节炎、类风湿性关节炎累及骨膜等，由于病因复杂且持续存在，疼痛缓解时间可能较短，一般在1-2周左右，部分患者甚至只能维持数天。\n- **功能改善方面**\n- 若骨膜炎症导致关节活动受限，在疼痛缓解的同时，关节功能也会有所改善。对于早期关节活动轻度受限的患者，功能改善可持续的时间与疼痛缓解时间相近。例如一些肩周炎患者，在打完骨膜封闭后，肩部疼痛减轻，关节活动范围扩大，这种功能改善可能持续1-3个月。\n- 但如果关节病变严重，已经出现了骨质破坏、关节畸形等情况，骨膜封闭对功能改善的持续时间可能较短，且效果有限，可能只能在短期内缓解因骨膜炎症导致的附加疼痛，对整体关节功能的恢复帮助不大。\n\n### 不良影响\n- **短期不良影响**\n- **局部反应**：注射部位可能会出现疼痛加重的情况，这通常是由于注射时对局部组织的刺激以及药物的作用所致，一般在注射后的1-3天内较为明显，随后会逐渐减轻。部分患者还可能出现局部肿胀，表现为注射部位的皮肤轻度隆起，这多是由于药物的局部刺激或过敏反应引起的，轻度肿胀一般在1周内可自行消退。\n- **过敏反应**：虽然较为少见，但少数患者可能对封闭所用的药物过敏，如出现皮肤瘙痒、皮疹等症状，严重者甚至可能出现过敏性休克。一旦发生过敏反应，需及时就医处理。\n- **长期不良影响**\n- **激素相关副作用**：如果长期、反复多次进行骨膜封闭治疗，尤其是使用糖皮质激素剂量较大时，可能会引起一些全身性的副作用。比如导致骨质疏松，增加骨折的风险；还可能影响血糖、血压的稳定，使原本血糖、血压正常的人出现血糖升高、血压波动等情况。\n- **感染风险**：由于封闭治疗是一种侵入性操作，若消毒不严格或患者自身免疫力低下，可能会引发注射部位的感染，出现红肿、疼痛加剧、发热等症状，严重时可能导致局部组织坏死，甚至引发全身性感染。\n- **组织粘连**：多次在同一部位进行骨膜封闭后，可能会引起局部组织的粘连，进而影响关节的活动功能。例如在膝关节处反复进行骨膜封闭，可能导致关节周围的肌肉、肌腱等组织粘连，使膝关节屈伸活动受限。",

      "problem_en": "What is the approximate duration of action after administration, and are there any other adverse effects?",
      "answer_en": "After periosteal blockade, the duration of its effects and potential adverse effects vary from person to person. The following are some common situations:\n\n### Duration of Effects\n- **Pain relief**  \nFor some patients with milder conditions and shorter disease course, such as local periostitis caused by mild overuse or minor trauma, after periosteal blockade the pain relief typically lasts for several weeks to even months. For example, some uncomplicated wrist tenosynovitis patients may experience a clear reduction in pain within 1-2 weeks after a single periosteal blockade, with the effect lasting about 2-3 months.\n- If the condition is more severe, such as advanced osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis involving the periosteum, due to complex and persistent etiologies, the pain relief duration may be shorter, generally around 1-2 weeks, with some patients only able to maintain relief for a few days.\n\n### Functional Improvement\nIf periosteal inflammation leads to restricted joint movement, joint function improves alongside pain relief. For patients with early, mild restriction of joint activity, the duration of functional improvement is similar to that of pain relief. For example, some shoulder periarthritis patients, after periosteal blockade, experience reduced shoulder pain and an expanded range of motion; this functional improvement may last 1-3 months.\nHowever, if the joint disease is severe, with bone destruction or joint deformities, the duration of functional improvement from periosteal blockade may be shorter and the effect limited, potentially only temporarily alleviating the additional pain caused by periosteal inflammation and contributing little to the overall recovery of joint function.\n\n### Adverse Effects\n- **Short-term Adverse Effects**  \n- **Local reactions:** The injection site may experience increased pain, typically due to irritation of local tissues during injection and the drug’s action, usually most noticeable within 1-3 days after injection and then gradually subsiding. Some patients may also experience local swelling, manifested as mild skin elevation at the injection site, largely due to local irritation or an allergic reaction to the drug; mild swelling generally resolves on its own within 1 week.\n- **Allergic reactions:** Although relatively rare, a minority of patients may be allergic to the drugs used for the blockade; symptoms such as itching, rash, and in severe cases anaphylaxis may occur. If an allergic reaction occurs, timely medical treatment is required.\n\n- **Long-term Adverse Effects**  \n- **Steroid-related side effects:** If periosteal blockade is performed long-term and repeatedly, especially with larger doses of glucocorticoids, some systemic side effects may occur. For example, osteoporosis with an increased risk of fractures; it may also affect the stability of blood glucose and blood pressure, causing elevated glucose levels or blood pressure fluctuations in individuals who previously had normal readings.\n- **Infection risk:** Because blockade therapy is an invasive procedure, if disinfection is not strict or the patient’s immune function is compromised, infection at the injection site may occur, presenting with redness, worsened pain, fever, etc., and in severe cases may lead to local tissue necrosis or even systemic infection.\n- **Tissue adhesions:** Repeated periosteal blockade at the same site may cause local tissue adhesions, thereby affecting joint function. For example, repeated periosteal blockade around the knee may promote adhesions of surrounding muscles, tendons, and other tissues, limiting knee flexion and extension.",

      "problem": "不孕症的评估需要用到子宫输卵管造影术，它的原理是什么？",
      "groupCode": 138,
      "sanswer": "子宫输卵管造影术的原理是通过向子宫腔和输卵管内注入造影剂，然后在X线透视下观察造影剂在子宫及输卵管内走向和弥散的路径，以此来评估子宫及输卵管的形态、位置及功能状态等。具体来说，其原理可以细化为以下几点：\n\n### 一、造影剂的选择和使用\n\n* **造影剂种类**：常用的造影剂有碘油和碘水。碘油黏稠度高，显影效果好，但吸收较慢；碘水流动性强，吸收快，副作用相对较小。\n* **造影剂注入**：通过宫颈将造影剂缓慢注入子宫腔，利用子宫腔的压力使造影剂进入输卵管。\n\n### 二、影像学成像技术\n\n* **X线造影**：能直观显示输卵管的形态和通畅情况，在X线透视下，造影剂在子宫和输卵管内形成的影像可清晰呈现其形态结构，依据造影剂能否顺利通过输卵管以及在盆腔的弥散情况来判断其通畅与否。\n* **超声造影**：利用高频声波和造影剂相结合，实时动态观察造影剂在输卵管内的流动情况，以及盆腔内的弥散情况。这种方式可从不同角度辅助观察输卵管内造影剂的流动细节，与X线造影起到互补作用。\n\n### 三、输卵管的生理结构和功能\n\n* **正常输卵管**：具有输送卵子和受精卵的功能，通畅的输卵管能让造影剂顺利通过。\n* **异常输卵管**：如出现堵塞、粘连、积水等情况，造影剂在输卵管内的充盈、弥散情况会受到影响，从而帮助医生判断输卵管是否存在异常。\n\n### 四、诊断依据\n\n* 根据造影剂在输卵管内的充盈、弥散情况，可以判断输卵管是否通畅、有无狭窄、堵塞或积水等异常。\n* 同时，还可以观察宫腔的形态、输卵管伞端开放状态以及盆腔造影剂弥散情况，以评估子宫及输卵管的整体功能状态。\n\n### 五、适应症与禁忌症\n\n* **适应症**：主要包括不孕症、子宫异常出血等，特别是疑似盆腔因素（尤其是输卵管因素）导致的不孕症者。\n* **禁忌症**：对碘过敏者、发热、月经期或不规则阴道流血、产后/流产/刮宫术后6周内等情况不宜进行子宫输卵管造影术。\n\n### 六、检查过程与注意事项\n\n* **检查过程**：患者平卧在检查床上，由护士在宫腔放置专用的子宫腔通液管，再由医生在机器下注入适量的造影剂。整个过程是动态的，可以充分显示整个检查过程的每一个环节。\n* **注意事项**：检查前需排空小便，避免大量饮水；检查前一周内应避免性生活；检查后两周内应避免盆浴和性生活，以防感染。\n\n综上所述，子宫输卵管造影术是一种安全、有效的检查方法，对于不孕症的评估具有重要意义。通过向子宫腔和输卵管内注入造影剂，并在X线透视下观察造影剂的走向和弥散情况，可以清晰地了解子宫及输卵管的形态、位置及功能状态等，为不孕症的诊断和治疗提供重要依据。",

      "problem_en": "The evaluation of infertility requires hysterosalpingography (HSG). What is its mechanism?",
      "answer_en": "### I. Selection and Use of Contrast Agents\n\n* **Types of contrast agents**: Common contrast agents include iodinated oil and iodinated water. Iodinated oil has high viscosity and good radiopacity but slower absorption; iodinated water is more fluid, absorbed quickly, and has relatively fewer side effects.\n* **Injection of contrast agent**: The contrast agent is slowly injected into the uterine cavity through the cervix, using the pressure within the uterine cavity to facilitate entry of the contrast agent into the fallopian tubes.\n\n### II. Imaging Techniques\n\n* **X-ray fluoroscopy**: Can visually display the morphology and patency of the fallopian tubes. Under fluoroscopy, the images formed by the contrast agent within the uterus and fallopian tubes clearly present their structural morphology, and patency is judged based on whether the contrast agent passes smoothly through the fallopian tubes and its dispersion in the pelvis.\n* **Ultrasound contrast imaging**: Uses high-frequency ultrasound waves combined with a contrast agent to observe in real time the flow of the contrast agent within the fallopian tubes and its dispersion in the pelvis. This method can assist in observing the flow details of the contrast agent within the tubes from different angles and complements X-ray imaging.\n\n### III. Physiological Structure and Function of the Fallopian Tubes\n\n* **Normal fallopian tubes**: Function to transport oocytes and fertilized eggs; patent tubes allow the contrast agent to pass through smoothly.\n* **Abnormal fallopian tubes**: Conditions such as occlusion, adhesions, or hydrosalpinx can affect the filling and dispersion of the contrast agent within the tubes, thereby helping clinicians determine whether the tubes are abnormal.\n\n### IV. Diagnostic Criteria\n\n* Based on the filling and dispersion of the contrast agent within the fallopian tubes, one can determine whether the tubes are patent and whether there is stenosis, obstruction, or hydrosalpinx.\n* Additionally, the morphology of the uterine cavity, the patency of the fimbrial end, and the dispersion of contrast in the pelvis can be observed to assess the overall function of the uterus and fallopian tubes.\n\n### V. Indications and Contraindications\n\n* **Indications**: Primarily infertility, abnormal uterine bleeding, etc., especially in infertility suspected to be due to pelvic factors (particularly tubal factors).\n* **Contraindications**: Iodine allergy, fever, menstruation or irregular vaginal bleeding, or within 6 weeks postpartum/after abortion/dilation and curettage, are not suitable for hysterosalpingography.\n\n### VI. Examination Procedure and Precautions\n\n* **Procedure**: The patient lies supine on the examination bed. A nurse places a dedicated uterine cavity infusion catheter into the uterine cavity, and then the physician injects an appropriate amount of contrast agent with the machine. The entire process is dynamic and can fully display every step of the examination.\n* **Precautions**: Empty the bladder before the procedure and avoid large amounts of fluid intake; avoid sexual activity in the week prior to the examination; for two weeks after the examination, avoid pelvic bathing and sexual activity to prevent infection.\n\nIn summary, hysterosalpingography is a safe and effective examination method with important significance for infertility evaluation. By injecting contrast agent into the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes and observing its course and dispersion under fluoroscopy, one can clearly understand the morphology, position, and functional status of the uterus and fallopian tubes, providing an important basis for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility.",

      "problem_en": "The vocal fold nodule has now progressed to a vocal fold polyp.",
      "answer_en": "### I. Causes\n\n1. **Voice misuse**:\n- Prolonged talking, singing loudly or shouting, and extended periods of speaking can lead to excessive friction and wear of the vocal cords, causing the vocal cord tissue to become overstressed and edema to develop, thereby forming vocal nodules. If this persists, vocal nodules may transform into vocal polyps.\n\n2. **Inflammatory stimulation**:\n- Prolonged inflammatory diseases such as chronic pharyngitis cause the pharyngeal mucosa to be subjected to inflammatory stimulation for a long time, leading to local congestion and edema, and a propensity for forming vocal nodules. If the inflammation is not effectively controlled, the nodules may further develop into vocal polyps.\n\n3. **Allergic reactions**:\n- If patients are sensitive to allergens such as pollen or dust and are frequently exposed, local allergic reactions may occur, leading to vocal cord edema and hyperplasia, ultimately forming vocal nodules. If the allergic reaction persists, it may also promote transformation of vocal nodules into vocal polyps.\n\n4. **Endocrine disorders**:\n- Long-term unhealthy lifestyle habits such as irregular dieting and staying up late may lead to endocrine disorders, reducing the body's immune function and increasing susceptibility to vocal nodules. If the endocrine disorder is not corrected, nodules may further develop into vocal polyps.\n\n### II. Symptoms\n\nDuring the transformation of vocal nodules into vocal polyps, patients may experience the following symptoms:\n\n1. **Hoarseness**:\n- Vocal nodules in the early stage can cause hoarseness; as the disease progresses, hoarseness may worsen and become persistent.\n\n2. **Effortful phonation**:\n- Because there are nodular-like lesions on the vocal cords, patients may feel effortful when voicing, and may even develop glottic stenosis.\n\n3. **Foreign body sensation in the throat**:\n- Some views suggest that patients with vocal nodules in the early stage may feel a foreign body sensation in the throat; the nodules themselves may irritate and compress laryngeal tissues, causing a foreign body sensation. In addition, the throat inflammatory response associated with the nodules can also cause throat discomfort, including a foreign body sensation. Another view holds that vocal nodules generally do not directly cause a foreign body sensation in the throat; nodules mainly affect vocal fold function and vibration, causing hoarseness and difficulty in phonation, with no direct relation to the throat, and thus do not directly cause a foreign body sensation.\n\n4. **Irritative dry cough**:\n- Prolonged inflammatory stimulation of the vocal cord mucosa may lead to an irritative dry cough.\n\n### III. Treatment\n\nFor vocal nodules transforming into vocal polyps, treatment mainly includes medical therapy and surgical therapy:\n\n1. **Medical therapy**:\n- If gastroesophageal reflux symptoms are present, medications such as omeprazole and domperidone may be used as prescribed.\n- For patients with severe allergic reactions, medications such as loratadine tablets and cetirizine hydrochloride tablets may be taken under medical supervision.\n\n2. **Surgical therapy**:\n- If drug therapy is ineffective or the polyps are large and affect phonation, surgical treatment may be considered. Procedures include excision of vocal nodules under suspension laryngoscopy, and laser excision under fiberoptic or electronic laryngoscopy.\n\n### IV. Prevention\n\nTo prevent the occurrence and progression of vocal nodules and polyps, the following measures are recommended:\n\n1. **Vocal hygiene**:\n- Regularly cleanse the vocal cords, such as by rinsing with clean water, saline, or boric acid mouthwash, which helps reduce inflammation and edema.\n\n2. **Lifestyle modification**:\n- Avoid prolonged talking, high-volume singing, or shouting and other overuse of the voice; avoid staying up late, smoking, and drinking; maintain adequate rest and sleep.\n\n3. **Dietary adjustments**:\n- Eat a light and easily digestible diet, avoid spicy irritants and cold drinks; consume plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits to supplement vitamins and minerals.\n\n4. **Management of related diseases**:\n- If gastroesophageal reflux, sinusitis, or other conditions are present, actively treat them to reduce irritation and damage to the vocal cords.\n\nIn short, the transformation of vocal nodules into vocal polyps is a progressive process. If related symptoms appear, seek medical attention promptly and receive professional treatment to control disease progression. At the same time, taking preventive measures to reduce the risk of vocal nodules and polyps is also very important.",

      "answer_en": "Costs for head CT, head MRI, and EEG at Chengdu West China Hospital, based on publicly available information, can be summarized as follows:\n\n| Examination item | Cost range (RMB) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Head CT | 300-500 RMB |\n| Head MRI | 500-1200 RMB |\n| EEG | 200-1000 RMB |\n\n### Details\n\n1. **Head CT**: The cost of a routine brain CT scan is usually between 300 and 500 RMB.

Brain diseases, such as ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, brain tumors, etc., can cause central vertigo. These conditions require diagnosis and treatment by specialized neurologists. Through head CT or MRI, neurologists can determine whether there is a brain lesion, thereby formulating a targeted treatment plan.\n2. **Otolaryngology (ENT)**: Vestibular system diseases are also a common cause of dizziness/vertigo, including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular migraine, usually related to inner ear dysfunction. Otolaryngology is the appropriate department to manage these conditions; ENT physicians can assess inner ear function through specialized tests, such as audiometric testing and vestibular function tests, and provide corresponding treatment recommendations.\n3. **Cardiology**: Shock may be related to heart disease, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and shock. Cardiologists can evaluate your heart health and perform necessary tests, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and echocardiography, to determine whether there is a cardiac disease, thereby formulating an appropriate treatment plan.\n4. **Emergency Medicine**: If your dizziness symptoms occur suddenly and are accompanied by severe headache, nausea, vomiting, or limb weakness, you should immediately seek care in the hospital’s emergency department. Emergency physicians will rapidly assess your condition and take appropriate emergency measures.\n\nWhen choosing a department, you can make a preliminary judgment based on the severity of your symptoms and accompanying signs. If you cannot determine which department to visit, you can first consult the hospital’s information desk or customer service staff; they will provide corresponding recommendations based on your condition.\n\nIn addition, dizziness can be caused by multiple factors, including low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, anemia, etc. At the time of visit, you can describe your symptoms, medical history, and potential triggers in detail to help the doctor make an accurate diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, maintaining good lifestyle habits and emotional state, and avoiding excessive fatigue and excessive stress, can also help relieve dizziness symptoms.",

      "answer_en": "Patients with gastroenteritis may use ginger foot baths, but should note the following points:\n\n### Effects of Ginger Foot Soaking\n* Ginger has the effects of warming the middle burner and dispelling cold, releasing the exterior and dispersing cold, warming the middle to stop vomiting, and warming the lungs to relieve coughing. Soaking the feet in ginger water can effectively dispel internal cold, raise body temperature, and achieve a warming effect to dispel cold and warm the body. In addition, ginger foot soaking can stimulate foot acupoints, enhance metabolism, and boost immunity.\n\n### Adjunctive Effects of Ginger Foot Soaking on Gastroenteritis\n* For stomach pain caused by cold stomach, ginger foot baths can provide some relief. By promoting blood circulation, ginger foot baths can help improve body coldness, thereby potentially alleviating gastroenteritis symptoms aggravated by cold.\n\n### Precautions\n* Ginger foot baths can only serve as an adjunctive treatment and cannot replace professional medical advice and pharmacotherapy. Patients with gastroenteritis should, while using ginger foot baths, also undergo medication treatment under the guidance of a physician.\n* When soaking feet, ensure the water temperature is not too high to avoid scalding the skin. Also, the soaking time should not be too long; generally, it is recommended to keep it within 15-30 minutes.\n* Gastroenteritis patients should maintain a light diet in daily life, avoid spicy, greasy, raw/cold, and irritating foods to prevent worsening of the condition.\n\n### Other Recommendations\n* If gastroenteritis symptoms are severe or persist, seek medical attention promptly to obtain professional diagnosis and treatment.\n* In addition to ginger foot baths, other traditional Chinese medicine foot bath formulas can be tried, such as ginger with Sichuan pepper, and the Dangshen-Bai Zhu-Cang Zhu formula, but they should also be used under the guidance of a physician.\n\nIn summary, gastroenteritis patients may use ginger foot baths as one of the adjunctive treatments, but should pay attention to the above considerations and combine with professional medical advice for treatment.",

      "answer_en": "ABO hemolysis titer is greater than 1:1000, indicating a high risk of hemolysis. ABO hemolysis refers to hemolytic disease of the newborn caused by ABO incompatibility between mother and infant, an important cause of neonatal jaundice and anemia. Regarding the worst outcomes when the ABO hemolysis titer is greater than 1:1000, the following are some possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Neonatal hemolytic jaundice**: This is the most common clinical manifestation of ABO hemolysis. Jaundice may appear within 24 hours after birth and can be more severe with a longer duration. If not treated promptly, kernicterus may occur, causing damage to the central nervous system.\n2. **Anemia**: ABO hemolysis leads to increased destruction of red blood cells, exceeding the bone marrow’s hematopoietic compensatory capacity, resulting in anemia. Severe anemia may cause tissue hypoxia, affecting the heart, brain, and muscles, and may lead to complications such as heart failure.\n3. **Hepatosplenomegaly**: During hemolysis, bone marrow hematopoietic function compensates to replenish the circulating blood volume, which may lead to hepatosplenomegaly. Hepatosplenomegaly can cause abdominal discomfort and reduced appetite; in severe cases, ascites and portal hypertension may occur.\n4. **Neurodevelopmental injury**: Unconjugated bilirubin may cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the central nervous system, causing bilirubin encephalopathy. Bilirubin encephalopathy can result in varying degrees of neurological damage, including motor disorders, intellectual impairment, and hearing loss.\n5. **Growth and development retardation**: Complications such as anemia and jaundice from ABO hemolysis may affect normal growth and development in newborns, resulting in slower height and weight gain, below the normal level for age.\n6. **Sequelae after neonatal exchange transfusion**: In severe cases, the newborn may require exchange transfusion to lower bilirubin concentration. However, exchange transfusion carries certain risks; improper procedure or infection can lead to complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or pulmonary hemorrhage, which may adversely affect the newborn’s long-term health.\n\nIt should be noted that although an ABO hemolysis titer greater than 1:1000 indicates a high risk of hemolysis, not all infants will develop the above severe consequences. With timely monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment, most infants can be effectively treated and recover. Therefore, once ABO hemolysis titer is abnormally elevated, seek medical attention promptly and follow medical advice.",

      "answer_en": "### I. Pharmacological Therapy\n\n* **Jaundice-relieving Chinese herbal medicines**: For mildly symptomatic neonates, jaundice-relieving Chinese herbal medicines can be given to alleviate symptoms. The components of these medicines are gentle and have little stimulation to the newborn's gastrointestinal tract.\n* **Probiotics**: Probiotics can accelerate the breakdown of bilirubin and promote its excretion from the intestines and urine, helping to alleviate jaundice symptoms.\n* **Immunoglobulin**: Intravenous administration of human immunoglobulin can block the binding sites of unconjugated bilirubin to its receptors, reducing uptake by the liver and thereby lowering bilirubin concentration.\n* **Hepatic enzyme inducers**: Such as phenobarbital, can enhance hepatic bilirubin metabolism and reduce unconjugated bilirubin levels.\n\n### II. Blue Light Phototherapy\n\n* **Phototherapy**: For neonates with more severe ABO hemolysis symptoms, blue light phototherapy is an effective treatment. By exposing the neonate's skin to blue light inside an incubator, bilirubin is broken down into water-soluble substances, which are subsequently excreted in urine and stool, thereby lowering serum bilirubin levels and alleviating jaundice symptoms.\n* **Notes**: The newborn skin is delicate, prolonged light exposure may cause skin allergies, but after stopping phototherapy, the allergic symptoms usually disappear on their own.\n\n### III. Transfusion Therapy\n\n* **Transfusion**: For neonates with particularly severe ABO hemolysis and accompanying severe anemia, transfusion therapy is necessary. Intravenous transfusion can rapidly replenish the newborn's deficient red blood cells, improve anemia, and also help lower serum bilirubin levels.\n* **Notes**: Blood transfusion must be strictly indicated and contraindication criteria observed to ensure safety and effectiveness of the transfusion process.\n\n### IV. Other Therapeutic Approaches\n\n* **Albumin Infusion**: Can raise plasma oncotic pressure, promote bilirubin excretion, and alleviate anemia symptoms. Used to correct anemia and maintain circulatory stability. Allergic reactions should be monitored.\n* **Splenectomy**: A surgical method to remove the spleen to relieve anemia and improve hematologic stability. Primarily used for diseases such as hereditary hemolytic anemia. Postoperative infection risk should be noted.\n* **Exchange Transfusion Therapy**: For severe neonatal ABO hemolytic disease, exchange transfusion therapy has relatively definite efficacy. By exchanging out a portion of blood containing free antibodies and sensitized red cells, hemolysis is reduced. A large amount of bilirubin is removed from the blood, preventing bilirubin encephalopathy, while correcting anemia, improving oxygen transport, and preventing heart failure.\n\n### V. General Therapy and Care\n\n* **General Therapy**: Includes timely warming, oxygen therapy, maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, and ensuring adequate nutrition.\n* **Close Observation and Nursing Care**: Healthcare professionals should regularly monitor the newborn's jaundice level, hemoglobin levels, and liver and kidney function, promptly identifying and addressing potential complications. Strengthening warmth, preventing infection, and ensuring proper feeding are essential nursing measures.\n\n### VI. Etiology Prevention and Intervention\n\n* **Antibody Testing**: For pregnant women known to have maternal–fetal ABO incompatibility, antibody testing should be performed during pregnancy to assess the risk of hemolysis.\n* **Preventive Treatment**: For high-risk pregnancies, preventive measures can be taken, such as intravenous immunoglobulin, to reduce the incidence of neonatal ABO hemolysis.\n\nIn summary, the treatment of ABO hemolysis after birth requires a comprehensive consideration of the infant's illness severity, general condition, and treatment resources. With timely and effective treatment and care, most infants can achieve a good prognosis.",

Indications and Contraindications\n\n* Indications: Penile catgut embedding suture technique is mainly suitable for patients with primary premature ejaculation who have higher glans sensitivity, stronger ejaculatory urges during intercourse, and abundant dorsal nerves of the penis.\n* Contraindications: If there are severe underlying diseases such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, etc., frenulum catgut embedding implantation is not recommended. Additionally, phimosis and balanoposthitis are not suitable for this procedure.\n\n### III. Efficacy and Risks\n\n* Efficacy: For some patients, penile catgut embedding suture technique can reduce glans sensitivity and prolong ejaculation time. However, the outcome varies among individuals, and not every patient achieves ideal treatment results.\n* Risks: The procedure may carry certain risks, such as infection, bleeding, local numbness, and loss of sexual pleasure. In addition, after the catgut is absorbed, the effect of the procedure may gradually diminish.\n\n### IV. Precautions\n\n* Preoperative preparation: Before undergoing the procedure, a comprehensive physical examination is required to ensure the patient meets the surgical indications and to exclude contraindications. It is also important to ascertain whether the patient has a history of allergies to avoid allergic reactions during the procedure.\n* Postoperative care: Postoperatively, keep the local area clean to prevent infection. Also ensure adequate rest and avoid vigorous exercise and overexertion. Diet should be light, with a preference for fresh vegetables and fruits.\n* Regular follow-up: After surgery, regular hospital visits for reassessment are needed so that the physician can promptly monitor recovery and provide appropriate management as needed.\n\nIn summary, patients with primary premature ejaculation and higher glans sensitivity may consider penile catgut embedding suture technique, but the exact effect varies among individuals.

      "sanswer": "人体内大小不同的肺泡保持压强平衡的关键在于肺泡表面活性物质。以下是对这一过程的详细解释：\n\n### 肺泡表面活性物质的作用\n\n* 肺泡表面活性物质是一种覆盖在肺泡液-气界面上的磷脂类物质，它以单分子层的形式存在，能够显著降低肺泡的表面张力。这种物质在呼吸过程中起着至关重要的作用，它能够调节大小肺泡的表面张力系数，从而稳定大小肺泡内的压强。\n\n### 肺泡压强平衡的原理\n\n* 在没有表面活性物质的情况下，如果各肺泡的表面张力系数相同，根据物理学原理，小泡内的压强会超过大泡，因为液泡越小，其中的压强越大。这样，当大小不同的两个液泡由一个管腔连通时，小泡内的气体将向压强较低的大泡流动，导致小泡越来越小，最终完全萎缩，而大泡则过度膨胀。\n* 然而，在人体内，由于肺泡表面活性物质的存在，这种情况被有效避免。表面活性物质能够根据肺泡的大小变化调节其表面张力系数。当肺泡增大时，活性物质在膜面的浓度变小，使表面张力系数变大；当肺泡缩小时，活性物质在膜面的浓度变大，使表面张力系数变小。这样，无论肺泡大小如何变化，其内的压强都能保持相对稳定。\n\n### 肺泡表面活性物质缺乏的影响\n\n* 如果肺泡表面活性物质缺乏，大小不同的肺泡将无法保持压强平衡。这会导致小肺泡因表面张力过大而萎缩，大肺泡则因过度膨胀而破裂。这种情况在医学上称为肺不张症，是一种严重的肺部疾病。\n\n综上所述，人体内大小不同的肺泡能够保持压强平衡，主要归功于肺泡表面活性物质对表面张力的有效调节。这种调节机制确保了呼吸过程的顺利进行，维护了肺部的正常功能。",

      "answer_en": "The key to maintaining pressure balance among alveoli of different sizes in the human body lies in alveolar surfactant. The following is a detailed explanation of this process:\n\n### Role of Alveolar Surfactant\n\n* Alveolar surfactant is a phospholipid substance that covers the alveolar liquid–gas interface and exists as a monolayer, capable of significantly reducing the surface tension of the alveoli. This substance plays a crucial role in respiration; it can regulate the surface tension coefficient of alveoli of different sizes, thereby stabilizing the pressure within alveoli of varying sizes.\n\n### Principle of Alveolar Pressure Balance\n\n* In the absence of surfactant, if the surface tension coefficients of the alveoli are the same, according to physical principles, the pressure inside the smaller alveolus would exceed that in the larger alveolus, because the smaller the vesicle, the greater the internal pressure. Thus, when two alveoli of different sizes are connected by a single lumen, the gas from the smaller alveolus will flow into the larger alveolus with lower pressure, causing the smaller alveolus to become smaller and eventually collapse completely, while the larger alveolus becomes overinflated.\n* However, in the human body, this situation is effectively avoided due to the presence of alveolar surfactant. The surfactant can regulate its surface tension coefficient according to the size of the alveolus. When an alveolus enlarges, the concentration of the surfactant on the membrane surface decreases, causing the surface tension coefficient to increase; when the alveolus shrinks, the concentration increases, causing the surface tension coefficient to decrease. In this way, regardless of how the alveoli change in size, the pressure inside them remains relatively stable.\n\n### Effects of Alveolar Surfactant Deficiency\n\n* If alveolar surfactant is deficient, alveoli of different sizes will be unable to maintain pressure balance. This will cause small alveoli to shrink due to excessive surface tension, while large alveoli overinflate and rupture. This condition is medically referred to as atelectasis, a serious lung disease.\n\nIn summary, alveoli of different sizes in the human body can maintain pressure balance largely thanks to the effective regulation of surface tension by alveolar surfactant. This regulatory mechanism ensures the smooth execution of the respiratory process and maintains normal lung function.",

Ranking of malignant tumor mortality in China\n* In 2022, the top five cancers by mortality in China were lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, and esophageal cancer.\n\n### 3. Global malignant tumor mortality overview\n* According to the 2022 global cancer statistics published by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, there were approximately 9.737 million global cancer deaths in 2022.\n* The top five cancers by deaths were lung cancer (1.817 million, 18.7%), colorectal cancer (0.904 million, 9.3%), liver cancer (0.758 million, 7.8%), female breast cancer (0.666 million, 6.9%), and stomach cancer (0.660 million, 6.8%).\n\n### 4. Trends in China's malignant tumor mortality\n* From 2000 to 2018, the age-standardized mortality rate for all cancers in China declined by an average of 1.3% per year. In particular, the age-standardized incidence and mortality rates for esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and liver cancer showed significant downward trends, reflecting China's long-standing commitment to comprehensive cancer prevention and control, and, in particular, the initial effects of gradually promoting upper gastrointestinal tract cancer screening since 2005.\n\n### 5. Urban-rural disparities in China's malignant tumor mortality\n* According to data from the National Cancer Center, there are urban-rural differences in malignant tumor mortality. The mortality-to-incidence ratio for malignant tumors is higher in rural areas than in urban areas, indicating that survival from malignant tumors is comparatively poorer in rural areas.\n\nIn summary, malignant tumor mortality is a complex indicator influenced by multiple factors. Although China has shown a downward trend in age-standardized mortality for all cancers in recent years, malignant tumors remain a major public health issue for China and the world. Therefore, strengthening prevention and early screening for malignant tumors, and improving public health awareness and healthcare capacity, are important for reducing malignant tumor mortality.",

      "answer_en": "# How Cochlear Implantation Helps Individuals with Congenital Deafness Regain Hearing\n\nCochlear implantation, also known as cochlear implant surgery, is an advanced medical technique to help individuals with congenital deafness regain hearing. The procedure directly stimulates the auditory nerve by implanting an electronic device, thereby bypassing the damaged cochlear structure and restoring hearing function. The following is a detailed overview of how cochlear implantation helps individuals with congenital deafness regain hearing:\n\n## 1. Preoperative Evaluation\n\nBefore proceeding with cochlear implantation, patients require comprehensive hearing assessments and medical examinations. This includes:\n\n- Hearing tests: to determine the degree and type of hearing loss.\n- Imaging studies: such as CT or MRI, to assess the structure of the cochlea and auditory nerve.\n- Other medical evaluations: to ensure the patient is suitable for surgery.\n\n## 2. Surgical Implantation\n\nCochlear implantation typically includes the following steps:\n\n- **Anesthesia**: The patient undergoes the procedure under general anesthesia.\n- **Incision**: A small incision is made behind the ear.\n- **Internal Implant Placement**: The implanted component of the electronic device is positioned within the cochlea, and the electrode array is inserted into the cochlea.\n- **Receiver and Stimulator**: The receiver and stimulator are implanted under the scalp.\n\n## 3. Postoperative Fitting\n\nAfter surgery, patients undergo a period of recovery and device programming:\n\n- **Device Activation**: Several weeks after surgery, the device is activated and undergoes initial programming.\n- **Speech Processor Adjustment**: The settings of the sound processor are progressively adjusted based on the patient’s hearing feedback to achieve optimal hearing outcomes.\n\n## 4. Hearing Rehabilitation\n\nFollowing cochlear implantation, patients require hearing rehabilitation training to adapt to the new auditory experience:\n\n- **Hearing Training**: Helps patients understand and recognize new sounds.\n- **Speech Therapy**: Especially for children, speech therapy helps develop language skills.\n- **Ongoing Follow-up**: Regular checks and device adjustments to ensure optimal performance.\n\n## 5. Outcomes and Limitations\n\nCochlear implantation can significantly improve hearing in many individuals with congenital deafness, but outcomes vary among individuals:\n\n- **Outcomes**: Most patients are able to hear environmental sounds and understand language to some extent.\n- **Limitations**: The surgery cannot restore normal hearing, and outcomes may be influenced by age, degree of hearing loss, and rehabilitation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCochlear implantation provides an effective pathway for hearing restoration in individuals with congenital deafness. Through surgical implantation and subsequent hearing rehabilitation, many patients can re-experience the world of sound and improve their quality of life. However, outcomes vary due to individual differences, so preoperative assessment and postoperative rehabilitation are crucial.",

      "problem_en": "Which age groups of patients are suitable candidates for undergoing this surgery?",
      "answer_en": "### Prelingual Deafness Patients\n\nPrelingual deafness refers to deafness and speech expression disorders that occur before the development of spoken language. For these patients, the optimal age range for cochlear implantation is generally 12 months to 6 years. This is because during this period, the child's auditory and language centers are still developing; early cochlear implantation can provide better auditory stimulation and promote the development of language and speech abilities. If the optimal implantation window is missed, even if they can hear sounds, their language abilities may decline significantly.\n\n### Postlingual Deafness Patients\n\nPostlingual deafness refers to deafness that occurs after the development of speech function. For these patients, cochlear implantation has no strict age limit. As long as the patient's physical and economic conditions permit and there are no surgical contraindications, implantation can be considered. Adults, and even the elderly, if they have bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural deafness due to disease or other causes and wearing a hearing aid cannot improve hearing, may also consider cochlear implantation.\n\n### Special Cases\n\n* For children with profound hearing loss: if diagnosed before 12 months of age, implantation should be performed as soon as possible within the next 6 months; if diagnosed after 12 months, implantation should be performed before age 2.\n* For elderly individuals aged 70 and above, although cochlear implantation is theoretically possible, the specifics require detailed examination and assessment.\n\n### Comprehensive Considerations\n\nWhen considering cochlear implantation, in addition to age, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the degree of hearing loss, etiology, physical condition, psychological status, and family and social support. Additionally, postoperative rehabilitation is also very important; it plays a crucial role in the recovery of the patient's hearing and speech abilities.\n\nIn summary, cochlear implantation is suitable for patients of all ages, but whether it is appropriate and the best timing for implantation should be evaluated based on the patient's individual circumstances. Therefore, before deciding to undergo surgery, patients should undergo a comprehensive hearing assessment and medical examination, and make decisions under the guidance of a qualified physician.",

      "answer_en": "Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease, CD) is a chronic nonspecific, skip-lesion, transmural inflammatory disease that can involve the entire gastrointestinal tract. Its clinical manifestations include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, hematochezia, abdominal masses, and fatigue. Malnutrition is a common complication of Crohn's disease and markedly affects patients' quality of life and clinical outcomes. Regarding the incidence of malnutrition in Crohn's disease patients, different studies provide a range of data. The following is a synthesis of these findings:\n\n### I. Overall Incidence\n\n* Some studies report that the prevalence of malnutrition in Crohn's disease reaches as high as 65.0%–75.0%.\n* Another study shows that among Crohn's disease patients hospitalized domestically for complications requiring surgery, the incidence of malnutrition is as high as 86.7%.\n* In 2017, a multicenter cross-sectional survey in China found that 55% of inflammatory bowel disease (Inflammatory Bowel Disease, IBD) patients have malnutrition, among whom Crohn's disease patients account for as high as 62%; among children, it can be as high as 100%; among hospitalized IBD patients, 20%–85% have malnutrition.\n\n### II. Incidence in Different Patient Groups\n\n* **Children and adolescents**: Growth retardation or stagnation is quite common in pediatric and adolescent Crohn's disease, and the incidence of malnutrition may be higher.\n* **Perioperative patients**: For patients with surgical indications (including Crohn's disease) who have malnutrition or are at risk of malnutrition, it is recommended to correct malnutrition first to reduce surgical risk. This indicates that malnutrition among perioperative Crohn's disease patients is relatively high.\n\n### III. Types and Severity of Malnutrition\n\n* Malnutrition in Crohn's disease patients is diverse, including protein–energy malnutrition, trace element and vitamin deficiencies, etc. Among them, protein–energy malnutrition is a prominent feature, presenting as weight loss, loss of subcutaneous fat, and muscle wasting.\n* The type and severity of malnutrition depend on disease duration, activity, and extent of involvement. Diseases involving the small intestine are more prone to protein–energy malnutrition and deficiencies of specific nutrients than colitis.\n\n### IV. Impact of Malnutrition\n\n* Malnutrition not only affects the physical health and quality of life of Crohn's disease patients but may also increase hospital admission rates, prolong length of hospital stay, reduce resistance to infection, impair healing of surgical incisions and intestinal anastomoses, and raise the risk of postoperative complications and mortality.\n\nIn summary, the incidence of malnutrition among Crohn's disease patients is high, and its impact on patients is substantial. Therefore, while treating Crohn's disease, nutritional support should be emphasized to improve patients' nutritional status and enhance treatment outcomes.",

Impact on Patients' Quality of Life\n\n1. **Digestive Tract Symptoms**: Patients with Crohn's disease commonly experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and blood in stool. These symptoms may prevent patients from eating normally, thereby affecting weight and nutritional status. Chronic diarrhea can lead to weight loss and malnutrition, further impacting patients' quality of life.\n2. **Intestinal Complications**: Crohn's disease can also cause intestinal complications such as intestinal obstruction, fistula, and perforation; these problems usually require surgical intervention and severely affect the patient's quality of life.\n3. **Systemic Manifestations**: Crohn's disease can cause systemic conditions such as arthritis, skin diseases (e.g., erythema nodosum), ocular problems (e.g., uveitis), and osteoporosis, further reducing patients' quality of life.\n4. **Psychological Impact**: Prolonged symptoms and restricted social activities may lead to anxiety and depression, significantly affecting patients' mental health and quality of life.\n\n### II. Impact on Disease Prognosis\n\n1. **Disease Activity**: Crohn's disease typically presents a chronic, progressive course; some patients achieve remission with treatment, while others may experience spontaneous remission. However, most patients experience relapses, with a prolonged course.\n2. **Complications**: The prognosis of Crohn's disease is influenced by multiple factors, among which the presence of complications is an important factor. Severe complications such as intestinal obstruction and perforation may require multiple surgeries, further affecting prognosis.\n3. **Risk of Malignancy**: Recent studies have also found an increased risk of cancer in Crohn's disease patients. Therefore, for Crohn's disease patients, especially those with longer disease duration, close monitoring and timely cancer screening and treatment are required.\n4. **Treatment Outcomes**: Treatment response is also an important determinant of Crohn's disease prognosis. Active and appropriate treatment can alleviate symptoms and reduce the occurrence of complications, thereby improving prognosis. Conversely, if patients do not receive active treatment or receive inadequate treatment, the disease may worsen, leading to a poor prognosis.\n\n### III. Summary\n\nCrohn's disease has a significant impact on patients' quality of life and prognosis.

      "answer_en": "Crohn's disease with severe complications such as intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, and other complex manifestations often requires surgical treatment, which is a commonly used and effective strategy. The following is a detailed summary of surgical treatment strategies:\n\n1. Surgical treatment of intestinal obstruction\n- **Resection of the obstructed segment**: For intestinal obstructions that recur or do not respond to non-surgical treatment, surgical resection of the obstructed bowel segment is a common approach. The operation aims to preserve as much functional bowel as possible while ensuring the resection range is sufficient to remove the lesion.\n- **Digestive tract reconstruction surgery**: In some cases, digestive tract reconstruction may be required to restore intestinal patency.\n- **Laparoscopic surgery**: As a minimally invasive surgical method, laparoscopic surgery has advantages of less trauma and quicker recovery, and is one of the recommended options for treating intestinal obstruction.\n\n2. Surgical treatment of intestinal perforation\n- **Emergency surgery**:\n- Crohn's disease with intestinal perforation usually requires emergency surgery to repair the perforation site and prevent further spread of infection.\n- The objectives of the surgery include repairing the perforation site, cleaning the intra-abdominal contamination, and, if necessary, resecting necrotic and damaged bowel segments.\n\n### 3. Comprehensive considerations\n\n1. **Preoperative preparation**:\n- For patients with obstructive bowel disease requiring surgical treatment, preoperative assessment includes comprehensive evaluation, including bowel imaging, MRI, gastrointestinal imaging, colonoscopy, etc., to understand the bowel condition and exclude colonic lesions.\n- Before surgery, patients should undergo thorough preoperative preparation, including improving nutritional status, adequately draining abscesses, and performing gastrointestinal preparation, etc.\n- For malnourished patients, nutritional support therapy may be needed to improve overall condition to better tolerate surgery.\n\n2. **Postoperative management**:\n- **Antimicrobial treatment**: Postoperatively, broad-spectrum antibiotics are used to prevent and control intra-abdominal infection.\n- **Nutritional support**: Provide energy and nutrients via parenteral nutrition to improve the patient’s nutritional status.\n- **Postoperative care**: Closely monitor vital signs, keep drainage tubes patent, and prevent complications.\n\n3. **Postoperative follow-up**:\n- Postoperative patients require regular follow-up to monitor disease progression and adjust treatment plans.\n- During follow-up, colonoscopy and other examinations may be performed to evaluate the disease and prevent recurrence.\n\n4. **Non-surgical treatment**:\n- Before deciding on surgery, non-surgical treatment is usually attempted first, such as bowel rest, nutritional support, and pharmacologic therapy, to relieve symptoms and reduce complications.\n\n5. **Long-term treatment**:\n- Crohn's disease is a chronic condition that requires long-term treatment and management.\n- Postoperative patients may continue to receive medical therapy targeted at Crohn's disease to control further disease progression and reduce the likelihood of relapse.\n\nIn summary, when Crohn's disease is complicated by severe complications such as intestinal obstruction and intestinal perforation, surgical treatment is an important treatment strategy. The specific surgical methods and postoperative management will be determined according to the patient's specific condition and the physician's judgment. At the same time, long-term treatment and management are also important measures to control the disease and prevent relapse.",

      "answer_en": "Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) plays an important role in the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Its mechanisms of action and the adverse effects associated with long-term use can be analyzed as follows:\n\n### Mechanism of action\n\n1. **Choleretic effect**: UDCA can increase bile secretion and gallbladder contraction, thereby promoting bile excretion, but it does not affect the size of the bile acid pool.\n2. **Decreases cholesterol saturation**: UDCA reduces cholesterol saturation in bile by inhibiting cholesterol reabsorption in the intestine and decreasing cholesterol secretion into bile, thereby lowering the cholesterol saturation in bile. This helps the gradual dissolution of cholesterol stones.\n3. **Substitution for toxic bile acids**: UDCA has hydrophilic and cytoprotective properties and can relatively substitute for lipophilic, detergent-like toxic bile acids, thereby reducing hepatocellular injury.\n4. **Immunomodulation**: UDCA can promote the secretory function of hepatocytes and has certain immunomodulatory effects, contributing to improved liver function.\n5. **Antioxidant**: UDCA can scavenge free radicals, counteract oxidative stress injury, and protect hepatocytes.\n\n### Long-term adverse effects\n\n1. **Gastrointestinal reactions**: Long-term use of UDCA may lead to gastrointestinal disturbances, with symptoms such as loose stools and diarrhea. Some patients may also experience nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating.\n2. **Hepatobiliary function disturbances**: Long-term use may lead to decreased bile secretion, cholangitis, progression of cholelithiasis, liver function impairment, and electrolyte disturbances. Patients may experience abdominal pain, fever, nausea and vomiting; in severe cases, septic shock may occur.\n3. **Allergic reactions**: In rare cases, patients may experience allergic reactions, such as urticaria and pruritus.\n4. **Other reactions**: Prolonged high-dose use of UDCA may exert hepatotoxic effects, leading to liver function impairment. Specifically, symptoms include fatigue, decreased appetite, right upper quadrant discomfort, nausea, and dark urine. In addition, it may affect electrolyte balance, causing electrolyte disturbances, triggering muscle cramps, arrhythmias, and even coma.\n\n### Precautions\n\n1. **Monitoring liver function**: During UDCA use, periodic monitoring of liver function and electrolyte levels should be performed to assess potential risks. If abnormalities are found, discontinue the drug promptly and consult a physician.\n2. **Take as prescribed**: UDCA is a prescription drug and must be used under a physician's guidance. If severe adverse reactions occur during treatment, seek medical attention.\n3. **Dietary adjustments**: During treatment, it is advisable to avoid spicy, irritant foods, especially fatty foods, to avoid affecting efficacy or worsening gastrointestinal discomfort.\n\nIn summary, UDCA has significant efficacy in treating PBC, but long-term use also carries certain adverse effects. Therefore, during treatment, close monitoring of the patient's condition is required, and dosing should be adjusted under the guidance of a physician.",

      "answer_en": "LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis) surgery is an ophthalmic procedure used to correct vision, primarily by precisely cutting and reshaping the cornea with a laser. The following describes how the laser precisely cuts the cornea during LASIK surgery:\n\n### 1. Preparation Stage\nBefore the surgery begins, the doctor performs a thorough eye examination to determine the patient's corneal thickness, curvature, and other relevant parameters. This information is used to formulate a personalized surgical plan.\n\n### 2. Creating the Corneal Flap\nAt the start of the procedure, the surgeon uses either a microkeratome (microkeratome blade) or a femtosecond laser to create a very thin corneal flap. This process requires extremely high precision to ensure the flap's thickness and diameter meet the surgical requirements.\n\n### 3. Laser Cutting\nOnce the corneal flap is lifted, the Excimer Laser is used to precisely cut and reshape the stromal layer of the cornea. The Excimer Laser is a cold laser, capable of removing corneal tissue with very high precision to alter its curvature, thereby correcting myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism.\n\n### 4. Precision of the Laser\n- Wavelength: The Excimer Laser's wavelength is typically 193 nm, enabling extremely precise cutting.\n- Computer Control: The laser cutting process is precisely controlled by a computer; the pre-set surgical parameters ensure the laser removes only the necessary corneal tissue.\n- Eye-Tracking Technology: Modern LASIK devices are equipped with eye-tracking systems that monitor tiny eye movements in real time and adjust the laser's direction and position to ensure cutting accuracy.\n\n### 5. Corneal Flap Repositioning\nAfter laser cutting is complete, the surgeon repositions the corneal flap. Due to the cornea's natural adhesiveness, the flap can adhere naturally without sutures.\n\n### 6. Recovery and Outcomes\nThe procedure typically lasts a few minutes, and the patient's vision gradually improves within days after the procedure. The high precision and rapid recovery of LASIK have made it a popular vision correction method.\n\nThrough the above steps, LASIK surgery can cut the cornea with extremely high precision to achieve vision correction.",

      "problem_en": "In a patient with Raynaud's phenomenon, what is the cause of recent finger ulcers and pain?",
      "answer_en": "### Causes of finger ulcers and pain\n\n1. **Vasospasm and ischemia**: The core pathologic change in Raynaud's phenomenon is vasospasm and ischemia of the distal vessels of the fingers. This spasm leads to reduced blood supply, tissue hypoxia, and in turn triggers a series of symptoms.\n\n2. **Tissue hypoxia and necrosis**: Prolonged ischemia and hypoxia can damage the distal finger tissues, potentially leading to necrosis. Necrotic tissue is prone to infection, forming ulcers.\n\n3. **Nerve terminal stimulation**: Ischemia and hypoxia also stimulate surrounding nerve endings, causing pain. This pain may be persistent or intermittent, depending on the severity and duration of the vascular spasm.\n\n### Influencing factors\n\n1. **Genetic factors**: Raynaud's phenomenon shows clear familial clustering; genetic factors are one of the major contributors to this condition.\n\n2. **Environmental factors**: Cold, dampness, and vibration, among other environmental factors, may worsen the symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon. Therefore, patients should pay particular attention to staying warm in cold environments.\n\n3. **Lifestyle factors**: Unhealthy lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and lack of exercise may increase disease risk or worsen symptoms. Therefore, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is particularly important for patients with Raynaud's phenomenon.\n\n### Treatment methods\n\nFor Raynaud's phenomenon finger ulcers and pain, treatment may include:\n\n1. **Daily care**:\n- Avoid exposing fingers to cold environments; wear gloves and other warming items.\n- Keep the skin at the ulcer site clean and dry to prevent infection.\n\n2. **Topical medications**:\n- Apply nitroglycerin ointment and other agents to promote wound healing and relieve pain.\n- If the ulcer area becomes inflamed, use erythromycin ointment or fusidic acid cream for anti-inflammatory and antibacterial therapy.\n\n3. **Oral medications**:\n- Take vasodilators such as nifedipine and nicardipine hydrochloride to improve circulation and reduce vasospasm.\n- If pain is significant, take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen sustained-release tablets or indomethacin capsules to relieve pain.\n\n### Precautions\n\n- Raynaud's phenomenon finger ulcers and pain do not heal spontaneously and require active treatment. If symptoms continue to worsen or other symptoms appear, seek medical attention promptly for professional evaluation and management.\n- In daily life, patients should keep warm, avoid emotional excitement and overexertion to reduce the frequency and severity of episodes.\n\nIn summary, the causes of finger ulcers and pain in Raynaud's phenomenon are mainly related to vasospasm and ischemia leading to tissue hypoxia and necrosis. Treatments include daily care, topical medications, and oral drugs, while patients should also avoid triggers and maintain a healthy lifestyle.",

      "problem": "生理期不规律但是不想吃激素药，还有什么办法可以快速调整生理周期？",
      "groupCode": 233,
      "sanswer": "生理期不规律但不想吃激素药，可以通过以下多种方法来快速调整生理周期：\n### 一、宫腔放置左炔诺孕酮宫内缓释系统\n该装置通过每日释放微量激素局部作用于宫腔，调节月经，适用于对口服激素药物接受度差的患者，且药物仅作用于子宫内膜，相比口服激素风险较低。\n\n### 二、调整生活习惯\n\n1. **规律作息**：保持充足的睡眠，尽量在相同的时间上床睡觉和起床。睡眠不足或作息不规律会影响内分泌系统，导致月经不规律。\n2. **适量运动**：选择适合自己的运动方式，如散步、瑜伽、慢跑等，每周进行3-5次，每次30分钟以上。适度的运动可以促进血液循环，缓解身体疲劳，有助于调节月经周期。但需注意避免过度劳累和剧烈运动。\n\n### 二、饮食调理\n\n1. **均衡饮食**：保证摄入均衡的营养，包括蛋白质、碳水化合物、脂肪、维生素和矿物质等。多吃新鲜的蔬菜、水果、全谷类食物、瘦肉、鱼类等，减少高脂肪、高糖、高盐食物的摄入。\n2. **补充营养物质**：增加摄入富含铁、蛋白质和维生素C的食物，如瘦肉、豆类、坚果和新鲜水果，可以帮助提高血红蛋白水平和减轻痛经症状。避免摄入过多咖啡因和酒精，它们可能会干扰雌激素的平衡。\n3. **避免刺激性食物**：减少辛辣食品、生冷食物以及咖啡、茶、酒精等饮料的摄入，这些食物和饮料可能会影响月经周期。\n\n### 三、心理调节\n\n1. **学会减压**：长期的精神压力会影响内分泌系统，导致月经不规律。可以通过听音乐、阅读书籍、冥想、深呼吸、旅游、与朋友交流等方式来缓解压力和焦虑情绪。\n2. **保持积极心态**：保持心情愉悦，避免过度紧张、焦虑等负面情绪。乐观的心态有助于维持内分泌系统的稳定。\n\n### 四、中医调理\n\n1. **中药调理**：中药具有温补、活血、调经等功效，可以帮助调理月经失调。常用的中药包括当归、川芎、白芍、熟地黄等。但需要在医生的指导下使用，根据病情的变化及时调整方剂。\n2. **针灸推拿**：针灸和推拿可以通过刺激特定的穴位，调节身体的气血流通，改善内分泌系统的功能，从而调节月经周期。\n\n### 五、其他非药物疗法\n\n1. **按摩穴位**：可以按摩身上的一些穴位，如终极穴、肾盂穴等，有助于缓解月经不调、腰酸背痛等病症。\n2. **食疗**：可以选择一些具有调经作用的食疗方，如将大枣、益母草、红糖加水炖煮后喝汤，或将鸡蛋和益母草一起炖煮后吃鸡蛋喝汤等。\n\n### 六、就医咨询\n\n如果以上方法无法有效改善月经不调的情况，或者月经不调的症状持续存在并伴随其他症状出现，应及时就医咨询专业医生。医生会根据患者的具体情况进行全面的检查，包括妇科检查、B超检查、内分泌检查等，以确定病因并采取相应的治疗措施。\n\n请注意，每个人的身体状况和月经不调的原因可能不同，因此需要根据自己的实际情况选择合适的方法进行调整。同时，保持良好的生活习惯和心态对于维护女性健康至关重要。",

      "problem_en": "Irregular menstrual cycles, but I do not want to take hormonal medications; what other methods are available to rapidly regulate the menstrual cycle?",
      "answer_en": "Irregular menstrual periods, but you do not want to take hormonal medications. The following methods can be used to quickly regulate the menstrual cycle:\n\n### I. Intrauterine levonorgestrel-releasing system placement\nThis device releases small amounts of hormone daily to act locally on the uterine cavity, regulating menstruation. It is suitable for patients with poor tolerance to oral hormonal medications, and the drug acts only on the endometrium, with lower risks than oral hormones.\n\n### II. Adjusting lifestyle\n\n1. **Regular sleep-wake schedule**: Maintain adequate sleep and try to go to bed and wake up at the same times each day. Sleep deprivation or an irregular schedule can affect the endocrine system, leading to irregular menstruation.\n2. **Moderate exercise**: Choose a form of exercise that suits you, such as walking, yoga, jogging, etc., 3–5 times per week, each session lasting at least 30 minutes. Moderate exercise can promote blood circulation, relieve bodily fatigue, and help regulate the menstrual cycle. However, avoid overexertion and strenuous exercise.\n\n### II. Dietary regulation\n\n1. **Balanced diet**: Ensure a balanced intake of nutrients, including proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Eat more fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean meats, and fish, and reduce intake of high-fat, high-sugar, and high-salt foods.\n2. **Nutrient supplementation**: Increase intake of foods rich in iron, protein, and vitamin C, such as lean meats, legumes, nuts, and fresh fruits, which can help raise hemoglobin levels and alleviate dysmenorrhea. Avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol, as they may disrupt estrogen balance.\n3. **Avoid irritant foods**: Reduce intake of spicy foods, cold/stale foods, and beverages such as coffee, tea, and alcohol, as these foods and drinks may affect the menstrual cycle.\n\n### III. Psychological regulation\n\n1. **Learn to manage stress**: Long-term psychological stress can affect the endocrine system, leading to irregular menstruation. Stress and anxiety can be relieved by listening to music, reading, meditation, deep breathing, travel, and socializing with friends.\n2. **Maintain a positive mindset**: Keep a cheerful mood and avoid excessive tension and anxiety. An optimistic mindset helps maintain endocrine stability.\n\n### IV. Traditional Chinese Medicine conditioning\n\n1. **Herbal therapy**: Chinese herbs have warming-tonifying, blood-invigorating, and menses-regulating effects, which can help address menstrual irregularities. Common herbs include Angelica sinensis (Dang Gui), Ligusticum chuanxiong (Chuan Xiong), Paeonia lactiflora (Bai Shao), and Rehmannia glutinosa (Shu Di Huang). However, they should be used under a physician’s guidance, with formulas adjusted as the condition changes.\n2. **Acupuncture and tuina**: Acupuncture and tuina can stimulate specific acupoints to modulate the body's qi and blood flow, improve endocrine function, and thereby regulate the menstrual cycle.\n\n### V. Other non-drug therapies\n\n1. **Massage of acupoints**: Massage certain acupoints on the body, such as the Ultimate acupoint and the kidney pelvis acupoint, which can help alleviate menstrual irregularities, low back pain, and related symptoms.\n2. **Dietary therapy**: You can choose some food-therapy recipes with menstrual-regulating effects, such as simmering red dates, motherwort (Yi Mu Cao), and brown sugar in water to make a soup and drinking it, or simmering eggs with motherwort and then eating the eggs with the soup.\n\n### VI. Medical consultation\n\nIf the above methods fail to effectively improve menstrual irregularities, or if symptoms persist and are accompanied by other symptoms, seek professional medical consultation promptly. A doctor will perform a comprehensive evaluation based on the patient’s specific situation, including gynecological examination, ultrasound, and endocrine testing, to determine the cause and undertake appropriate treatment.\n\nPlease note that each person’s physical condition and the cause of menstrual irregularity may differ, so it is necessary to choose appropriate methods based on one’s actual circumstances. At the same time, maintaining good lifestyle habits and a positive mindset is crucial for protecting women’s health.",

      "answer_en": "Numbness in the hands after cancer surgery and chemotherapy may be caused by multiple factors, including neurotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs, electrolyte disturbances, and psychological factors. To establish a definite diagnosis and formulate an appropriate treatment plan, the following examinations are recommended:\n\n1. **Cranial MRI (MRI)**: If the patient, in addition to hand numbness, also experiences headaches, dizziness, vision changes, limb weakness with progressive sensory impairment, etc., a cranial MRI should be considered to exclude intracranial metastases and other potential causes of hand numbness.\n\n2. **Electromyography (EMG)**: EMG is a method that records the electrical activity of muscles at rest or during contraction and assesses muscle excitability and conduction by applying electrical stimulation. Through EMG testing, the function of peripheral nerves and muscles can be evaluated, helping to diagnose chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.\n\n3. **Electrolyte testing**: Chemotherapy may lead to loss of electrolytes such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium, and electrolyte imbalance can affect normal neuromuscular function. Electrolyte testing can assess the body's electrolyte levels and provide a basis for treatment.\n\n4. **Cervical spine evaluation**: Perform cervical CT or MRI to specifically evaluate for cervical disc herniation, cervical spondylosis, and other conditions that may compress nerve roots, thereby determining whether hand numbness is due to cervical problems.\n\n5. **Psychological assessment**: Patients undergoing chemotherapy may experience substantial psychological stress; negative emotions may worsen physical discomfort. Therefore, psychological assessment helps understand the patient's mental state and provides appropriate psychological support and reassurance.\n\n6. **Complete blood count and liver and kidney function tests**: These tests can assess the patient's overall condition, evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on the body, and detect other potential complications.\n\nWhile performing the above examinations, patients can also take the following measures to relieve hand numbness:\n\n1. **Physical therapy**: For example, local warm compresses and massage can promote blood circulation and reduce hand numbness.\n\n2. **Pharmacologic treatment**: If electrolyte disturbances are found, such as hypocalcemia, calcium supplementation should be given as advised by a doctor; hypokalemia should be corrected with potassium supplementation, etc., to address electrolyte imbalances. At the same time, methylcobalamin and vitamin B1, among other neuronutrition drugs, can be used to nourish the nerves and gradually restore function. However, these should be used under physician supervision.\n\n3. **Lifestyle adjustment**: Maintain adequate sleep; schedule rest according to the chemotherapy cycle, and during chemotherapy you may appropriately increase daytime naps. In terms of diet, ensure adequate protein intake, such as lean meat, fish, eggs, beans, etc.; eat more fresh vegetables and fruits to supplement vitamins and minerals and promote recovery. Avoid excessive fatigue; during the period when the body is weak after chemotherapy, focus on light activities such as walking, and gradually increase activity as the body recovers, but avoid vigorous exercise.\n\nPlease note that the above examinations and treatment recommendations are for reference only. The specific situation should be determined according to the patient’s actual condition and the doctor's advice. When hand numbness or other symptoms occur, seek medical attention promptly and follow the doctor's guidance.",

      "answer_en": "### I. Prevention of Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases\n\n* **Application scenarios**: Aspirin is widely used in the prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, etc.\n* **Mechanism of action**: Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation and prevents thrombosis, thereby significantly reducing the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. It inhibits cyclooxygenase in platelets, reducing platelet adhesion and aggregation, thereby preventing rupture of atherosclerotic plaques and thrombus formation. For patients with coronary heart disease, long-term aspirin therapy can reduce myocardial injury and thrombosis caused by hypoperfusion; for patients with cerebral infarction, in addition to inhibiting platelet aggregation, aspirin can also prevent new thrombus formation, reducing the risk of stroke recurrence.\n\n### II. Antipyretic, Analgesic and Anti-inflammatory\n\n* **Application scenarios**: Aspirin can be used to relieve mild to moderate pain such as headache, toothache, neuralgia, muscle pain, and dysmenorrhea, and can also be used for fever reduction in the common cold.\n* **Mechanism of action**: Aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase in T cells, reducing the synthesis of prostaglandins, thereby alleviating joint inflammation and pain. At the same time, it can also cause vasodilation, reducing pain sensation, achieving analgesic effects. Additionally, aspirin blocks the synthesis of arachidonic acid, reducing the production of inflammatory mediators, providing anti-inflammatory effects, and is commonly used to treat rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, effectively alleviating pain and swelling caused by inflammation.\n\n### III. Anti-rheumatic and Arthritis Treatment\n\n* **Application scenarios**: Aspirin can be used in the treatment of rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.\n* **Mechanism of action**: The anti-inflammatory effect of aspirin plays an important role in the treatment of rheumatic diseases. It inhibits cyclooxygenase in T cells, reducing the synthesis of prostaglandins, thereby relieving joint inflammation and pain. For patients with rheumatoid arthritis, aspirin can alleviate joint swelling, pain, and stiffness, improving quality of life.\n\nIn summary, aspirin plays an important role in preventing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, fever reduction, analgesia and anti-inflammatory effects, and anti-rheumatic and arthritis treatment, etc. However, when using aspirin, be sure to follow medical advice, and pay attention to the dosage and administration to avoid potential adverse reactions.",

The following are related recommendations:\n\n### Testing Methods\n\n- **Nontreponemal syphilis serology tests (e.g., RPR or VDRL)**:\n- These tests detect non-specific antibodies produced in response to syphilis infection.\n- In newborns, these antibodies may come from the mother, so false positives can occur.\n\n- **Specific syphilis serology tests (e.g., TPPA or FTA-ABS)**:\n- These tests detect specific antibodies against Treponema pallidum.\n- Because newborns may inherit maternal antibodies, these tests may be positive at birth as well.\n\n- **PCR testing**:\n- Direct detection of Treponema pallidum DNA.\n- In newborns, it has higher specificity and sensitivity.\n\n### Timing of Testing\n\n- **At birth**:\n- Initial testing can be performed at birth to identify possible infection.\n\n- **2-3 months of age**:\n- If the initial test result is inconclusive or positive, it is recommended to recheck at 2-3 months.\n- At this time, maternal-transmitted antibody levels decline, while the newborn's own antibody levels become more evident.\n\n- **After 6 months**:\n- If concerns remain, retesting after 6 months can help confirm infection status, because by this time maternal antibodies have largely disappeared.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor newborn syphilis testing, PCR testing methods are more accurate, especially in suspected congenital syphilis. The initial test should be performed at birth, but to improve diagnostic accuracy, follow-up testing is very important, especially tests performed at 2-3 months and at 6 months.",

      "answer_en": "Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, mainly used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. The following are the infection types Levofloxacin is commonly used to treat and its advantages relative to other antibiotics:\n\n### Major infection types Levofloxacin is commonly used to treat\n\n1. **Respiratory tract infections**\n- Community-acquired pneumonia\n- Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis\n- Sinusitis\n\n2. **Urinary tract infections**\n- Complicated urinary tract infection\n- Acute pyelonephritis\n\n3. **Skin and soft tissue infections**\n- Complicated skin and skin-structure infections\n\n4. **Intra-abdominal infections**\n- Complicated intra-abdominal infections\n\n5. **Other infections**\n- Prostatitis\n- Anthrax (inhalational)\n\n### Advantages of Levofloxacin\n\n1. **Broad-spectrum antibacterial activity**\n- Levofloxacin is active against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and it also has antibacterial activity against certain resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Escherichia coli), which allows it to be effective in infections where treatment with other antibiotics is less effective.\n\n2. **Good tissue penetration**\n- The drug penetrates tissues and body fluids well, making it more effective in treating deep-seated infections.\n\n3. **Similar bioavailability for oral and intravenous administration**\n- Levofloxacin has similar bioavailability for oral and intravenous administration, providing flexible dosing options in clinical practice; for example, for patients with relatively mild illness who can take oral medications, oral dosing can be chosen; for more severe illness or inability to take oral medications, intravenous administration can be promptly transitioned, while ensuring similar therapeutic effect, greatly facilitating the treatment process.\n\n4. **Fewer drug interactions**\n- Compared with some other antibiotics, Levofloxacin has fewer drug interactions. For example, when used with common antihypertensive or antidiabetic drugs, it generally does not affect the efficacy of these medications or cause serious adverse reactions in combination, making it comparatively safer and reducing the likelihood of dose adjustments during combination therapy.\n\n5. **Longer half-life**\n- Its longer half-life allows once-daily dosing regimens, improving patient adherence.\n\nIt should be noted that, although Levofloxacin has these advantages, its use may also be associated with some adverse effects, such as tendinitis, tendon rupture, and QT interval prolongation. Therefore, before use, a thorough assessment of the patient’s specific situation should be performed, and medical guidance should be followed.",

      "answer_en": "During the recovery process after exercise, carbohydrates and fats both play important roles, but their functions and optimal intake methods differ. The following is an analysis of their respective roles and recommendations on how to balance their intake:\n\n### Role of Carbohydrates\n\n1. **Restoration of muscle glycogen**: Exercise, especially high-intensity or long-duration activity, depletes muscle glycogen stores. Carbohydrates are key to restoring these stores.\n\n2. **Promoting protein synthesis**: Carbohydrate intake can stimulate insulin secretion, and insulin helps amino acids enter muscle cells, thereby promoting protein synthesis.\n\n3. **Enhancing immune function**: Carbohydrate intake after exercise can help maintain normal immune system function and reduce exercise-induced immunosuppression.\n\n### Role of Fat\n\n1. **Providing energy**: Fat is the main energy source for prolonged low-intensity exercise, helping to spare muscle glycogen.\n\n2. **Supporting cellular function**: Fat is an important component of cell membranes and essential for normal cellular function.\n\n3. **Aiding vitamin absorption**: Fat helps with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins A, D, E, and K), which are crucial for recovery and health.\n\n### How to Balance Intake\n\n1. **Replenish carbohydrates immediately after exercise**: Consuming carbohydrates within 30 minutes to 2 hours after exercise can maximize muscle glycogen restoration. It is recommended to consume about 1.0–1.2 grams of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight.\n\n2. **Moderate fat intake**: Although fat is not a priority energy source after exercise, moderate intake of healthy fats (such as unsaturated fats from nuts, seeds, and fish) is beneficial. Fat intake should account for 20–35% of total calories.\n\n3. **Combine protein and carbohydrates**: The combination of carbohydrates and protein can further promote recovery. The ideal carbohydrate-to-protein ratio is 3:1 or 4:1.\n\n4. **Personalized adjustments**: Adjust carbohydrate and fat intake ratios according to individual exercise intensity, duration, and goals (such as muscle gain or fat loss).\n\nWith a well-planned nutrition strategy that combines carbohydrate and fat intake, recovery after exercise can be effectively promoted and overall athletic performance can be enhanced.",

Medical records of 153 women referred for colposcopy (n=90) and 225 women referred for repeat Pap testing were sought and reviewed. Routine clinic follow-up protocols—phone calls, letters, or certified mail—were applied regardless of the type of Pap smear abnormality or the recommended testing. Follow-up adherence was recorded within eight months after the abnormal result. From the medical records, data were abstracted on attempts to contact patients for follow-up, adherence to the follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics. Survival analysis was used to model the probability of follow-up adherence as a function of the number of follow-up attempts. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariable relationships with adherence. Overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence for a second colposcopic examination did not differ significantly from adherence for a repeat Pap smear (hazard ratio 1.40; 95% CI 0.80–2.46). Using up to three patient reminders markedly increased follow-up adherence. Women without health insurance and those treated at one of the three clinics were less likely to follow any follow-up recommendations (uninsured HR 0.43 [95% CI 0.20–0.93], clinic HR 0.35 [95% CI 0.15–0.73]). Based on the above conclusions, do the follow-up recommendations for abnormal Pap smears influence patient adherence?",
      "answer_en": "No. In the population at this family planning clinic, regardless of the type of follow-up recommended, adherence is low; adherence can be improved by using up to three reminders."

After treatment with entecavir, symptoms improved, and he has continued the medication to date. One month ago, right-sided rib discomfort worsened, with an approximate weight loss of 6 kg. An ultrasound at an external hospital suggested a hyperechoic intrahepatic mass, raising the possibility of a hepatic space-occupying lesion. He was referred to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment.\n\nPast history: no allergies, no trauma or prior surgery, and no special residence or exposure history. Six years of hepatitis B history, no deleterious habits. Family history: no infectious or genetic diseases.\n\nExamination: development normal, nutritional status relatively poor, conscious, mental status generally normal. Neck soft, clear breath sounds in both lungs, regular heart rhythm, abdomen soft and non-tender, liver and spleen not palpable, bowel sounds normal, no edema of the lower extremities. No jaundice, complexion somewhat dark, signs of liver disease, spider angiomata visible.\n\nAuxiliary tests: Abdominal ultrasound showed a liver mass with medium-high echogenicity. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the upper abdomen showed a focal lesion in the left lobe of the liver measuring 5.5 × 6 cm, suspected hepatocellular carcinoma; mild cirrhosis; multiple small and mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the hepatogastric space and retroperitoneum.\n\nLaboratory examinations: Liver function showed alanine aminotransferase 61 U/L (elevated), aspartate aminotransferase 42 U/L (elevated), alkaline phosphatase 98 U/L (normal), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 52 U/L (normal), total bilirubin 8.9 μmol/L (normal), albumin 48.5 g/L (normal), total cholesterol 3.49 mmol/L (normal), triglycerides 1.17 mmol/L (normal), high-density lipoprotein 0.81 mmol/L (decreased). Tumor markers: α-fetoprotein 5.46 μg/L (normal), CEA and CA19-9 normal.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment course: The patient, with a six-year history of hepatitis B and recent right rib discomfort with weight loss, underwent comprehensive evaluation after admission. He was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. Imaging suggested no distant metastasis and suitability for surgical treatment. Preoperative preparation included transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Postoperatively, fever and abnormal liver function occurred, but improved after anti-infective and hepatoprotective therapy.

      "answer_en": "Note! If the student does not explicitly mention “the disease has progressed to the late stage,” it will be considered wrong and only 3 points can be awarded! Rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation can lead to increased left atrial pressure, which in turn raises pulmonary venous pressure, ultimately causing pulmonary hypertension. Long-standing pulmonary hypertension increases the workload on the right heart, leading to right heart failure. After right heart failure, systemic venous congestion leads to esophageal and gastric fundal varices. When these varices rupture, hematemesis occurs. This indicates that the condition may already be relatively severe and that cardiac function has been substantially affected. From a current medical perspective, for rheumatic heart disease with mitral valve disease progressing to severe symptoms such as hematemesis and dyspnea, complete cure (i.e., restoring to a state with no heart disease) is quite difficult. However, certain treatments can be used to improve symptoms, slow disease progression, and improve quality of life."

      "answer_en": "For the diagnosis of breast masses, histopathological examination is usually required to determine their nature. Common histopathological examinations include fine-needle aspiration cytology, which can obtain cytological evidence but may not provide sufficient histological information; core-needle biopsy can obtain an adequate tissue sample, suitable for larger masses where the location permits, providing a more accurate qualitative diagnosis of the mass; incisional biopsy is relatively more complex and carries higher risks, and is usually not the first-choice method. Therefore, core-needle biopsy is the best qualitative diagnostic method."

Disorientation: The patient shows disorientation to place or context, which is a typical manifestation of cognitive impairment.\n3. Neuropsychiatric symptoms: The patient exhibits anxiety exacerbation, impaired balance, urinary urgency and incontinence, etc., which may be accompanying symptoms of cognitive impairment.\n4. Motor symptoms: The patient has low-frequency tremor in the right arm, which may be an early manifestation of Parkinson’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease sometimes have overlapping pathology and clinical features.\n5. Alcohol use: The patient drinks 4–6 glasses of wine daily, which may negatively affect cognitive function but is not sufficient to explain all cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms.\n6. History and physical examination: The patient’s history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as obesity (BMI 31 kg/m^2), are risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease. The pulse and blood pressure on examination were within normal limits, with no other obvious neurological abnormalities detected.\n\nIn summary, the patient’s symptoms and signs are most consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. However, to establish a definitive diagnosis, further neuropsychological testing, brain imaging studies (such as MRI), and biomarker testing (e.g., levels of beta-amyloid protein and tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid) may be required."

After surgery I have been taking 100 mg Bayer aspirin daily, for nearly two and a half years, but after stopping the medication occasional headaches still occur, and factors such as colds have been ruled out. Whenever I have a headache I take one aspirin tablet, and the course lasts 1–2 days. The most recent headache episodes occurred on September 10, 2014; November 9, 2014; and November 17, 2014, and there is a trend toward increasing frequency. Although I have been following the doctor's instructions, taking the medication, and undergoing regular follow-up with cardiac color Doppler echocardiography and ECG, and the doctor has said my recovery is very good with no abnormalities, the headaches have not disappeared. Would vitamin B1 help relieve my current symptoms? How should I take it?",

However, if the student does not explicitly state 'Vitamin B1 has a regulatory effect on neural conduction and can aid in treating headaches' or a similar viewpoint, only 3 points can be awarded!"

A 47-year-old male with scleral icterus and dark urine, poor appetite for 1 week, with a long history of heavy alcohol use.\n2. Severe jaundice of the skin and sclera; abdominal examination reveals no obvious abnormalities.\n3. Auxiliary tests show abnormal liver function, supporting the diagnosis.\n\n#Differential Diagnosis#:\nHepatocellular carcinoma: Considering the patient’s clinical presentation and abnormal liver function, differentiation from hepatocellular carcinoma is needed; an upper abdominal CT scan is recommended.\n\n#Clinical Course and Treatment#:\nAfter admission, the patient underwent comprehensive examinations and was found to have HBV “three-positive” pattern and positive hepatitis A antibodies. Liver fibrosis markers were elevated; urinalysis showed positive urobilinogen and bilirubin. CA 19-9 was mildly elevated; other tests were unremarkable. Antibodies to hepatitis E virus indicated past infection. Diagnosed with acute icteric hepatitis A and chronic hepatitis B. Treatment included liver-protective and enzyme-lowering therapy, cholagogic and jaundice-reducing therapy, and antiviral therapy. After 12 days of treatment, symptoms improved and the patient was discharged.\n\n#Diagnoses#:\n1. Acute icteric hepatitis A\n2. Chronic hepatitis B\n\n#Analysis and Summary#:\nThe treatment principles for acute icteric hepatitis A are rest, nutrition, and selective pharmacotherapy. Avoid alcohol, prevent overexertion and hepatotoxic medications. Discharge after symptoms disappear and liver function normalizes. During the recovery period, gradually increase activity and avoid fatigue. If necessary, intravenous nutrition and electrolyte supplementation. Traditional Chinese medicine treatment can be selected according to the clinical condition."

Blood pressure was measured at 180/110 mm Hg, and a right adrenal adenoma, 2 cm in size, was detected, leading to adrenal adenoma resection. After surgery, antihypertensive medications were changed several times, adherence to medication was irregular, and blood pressure did not drop markedly, fluctuating between 150–170/100–120 mm Hg. A CT recheck six months postoperatively showed an enlarged left adrenal gland, which was left untreated.\n\nOne year ago she again developed fatigue, which worsened one month ago and led to a fall. Serum potassium was 1.4 mmol/L. She was hospitalized and received potassium supplementation, after which potassium recovered to 4.07 mmol/L and fatigue improved. At the same time, a left adrenal occupying lesion was found. A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT two weeks ago showed postoperative changes after right adrenal adenoma resection; the residual adrenal tissue ends were slightly thickened, and the left adrenal gland had a larger soft-tissue occupying lesion measuring 6 cm × 2.4 cm.\n\nTests at 8 am: cortisol 1.32 μg/dL ↓ (normal 4.4–17.9 μg/dL), ACTH 57.6 pg/mL ↑ (normal 0–37.4 pg/mL); standing aldosterone 170 pg/mL (normal 68–300 pg/mL); standing renin 53 pg/mL ↑ (normal 7–40 pg/mL); sex hormones at an early postmenopausal level (see Table 1). Gynecologic examination showed an infantile-type vulva, intact hymen, vagina 6 cm, rectal exam showed no uterus, bilateral adnexa without masses; diagnosed with primary gonadal dysgenesis. Ultrasound showed congenital absence of the uterus. Hypoplastic uterus? Bilateral ovaries not visualized. CT showed a small uterus. She was admitted for further diagnostic work-up to our department.\n\nPast history: ten years ago, due to primary amenorrhea, chromosome analysis showed 46XX; she had estrogen replacement therapy for six months, later stopped due to gastrointestinal side effects. For many years she had intermittent dizziness and headaches. About 2 months ago, head CT at another hospital showed multiple cerebral infarcts; after symptomatic treatment, she improved with no residual limb dysfunction. In this admission, another cerebral infarct occurred; examination confirmed moyamoya disease.\n\nPersonal history: height and weight development were normal; after age 22 she grew an additional 2 cm. She is currently married and nulliparous.\n\nFamily history: both parents are healthy, non-consanguineous marriage; a younger brother healthy. Denies family history of hereditary diseases.\n\nOn admission examination: BP 155/120 mm Hg, pulse 80/min, weight 57 kg, height 173 cm, BMI 19 kg/m2, upper segment 79 cm, lower segment 94 cm, arm span 173 cm.

Not those related to cells.\n\nStructure of the human brain: The human brain is nature's most remarkable creation, consisting of the cerebrum, cerebellum, diencephalon, midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. The brain is made up of two hemispheres, left and right, among which the most important part is the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is gray-white in color and covers the surface of the brain; it has many folds (also called sulci and gyri). The cerebral cortex (also called the cortex) contains about 10–14 billion cells, these cells are divided into neurons and glial cells. Neurons are the basic units of brain activity, supporting the brain's complex specialization and determining human intelligence. Each neuron has 40–100 tree-like dendritic processes; these projections extend, forming a dense neural network, which is brain development. Glial cells supply nutrients to neurons. The cerebellum's main function is to maintain muscle tone, coordinate movement and posture, and balance. The medulla oblongata, pons, midbrain, and diencephalon comprise the brainstem; it connects upward to the brain, downward to the spinal cord, and posteriorly with the cerebellum; all nerve fibers traveling between the brain and the cerebellum and spinal cord must pass through the brainstem. The brainstem is also the origin of many important cranial nerve nuclei. In the diencephalon, the hypothalamus is the subcortical center for the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, closely related to a variety of physiological functions such as body temperature, appetite, and vascular responses. The medulla oblongata is the site of centers for respiration, heartbeat, and vasomotor activity.",

      "problem_en": "[Patient] Four days ago the child complained of a sore throat, at night breathing heavily, and always having trouble sleeping soundly. We gave Pudilan for three days and azithromycin pink liquid syrup for three days. After that, the throat no longer hurts, nighttime breathing isn’t as heavy, and she sleeps more soundly, but at night she occasionally coughs and feels phlegm. During the day she doesn’t cough and hasn’t expectorated phlegm; it’s only at night that there are symptoms. What is going on? Now I am only giving her Xiao’er Lung-Heat Cough and Wheeze Oral Liquid, which she just started yesterday. Is it okay to take this medication? (Male, age: 4 years)\n\n[Doctor] The child has nighttime coughing and phlegm symptoms, which may be related to multiple factors. First, you mentioned the child previously had a sore throat, heavy nighttime breathing, and unsettled sleep. After treatment with Pudilan and azithromycin, these symptoms have improved, suggesting there may be an upper respiratory tract infection or tonsillitis. To better understand the child’s condition, I need to confirm a few things:\nDoes the child have any history of allergies or a family history of allergies?\n\n[Patient] No allergy history; no one in the family has allergies. Doctor, should we continue giving Xiao’er Lung-Heat Cough and Wheeze Oral Liquid? He coughs at night, but drinking a little water helps.\n\n[Doctor] Understanding that the child has no allergy history helps exclude some allergic diseases. Regarding continuing Xiao’er Lung-Heat Cough and Wheeze Oral Liquid, this medication is typically used to clear heat and detoxify, loosen phlegm, and stop coughing, and it has a certain effect on relieving cough and phlegm caused by respiratory infections. To more comprehensively evaluate the child’s condition, I also need to know the following:\nWhat is the child’s body temperature? Is there fever?\n\n[Patient] I’m not sure about the child’s temperature, because there is no fever, so it hasn’t been measured. Doctor, why does his nighttime cough ease when he drinks water?\n\n[Doctor] The nighttime cough improves after drinking water, which may be related to several factors:\n1. **Airway dryness**: Nighttime air is relatively dry, which can dry the airway mucosa and stimulate the cough reflex. Drinking water can moisten the airway and relieve coughing.\n2. **Positional effect**: When lying flat, airway secretions tend to accumulate, causing coughing. Drinking water may help flush out secretions and relieve coughing.\n3. **Gastroesophageal reflux**: When lying flat at night, stomach acid reflux can irritate the throat and cause coughing. Drinking water can dilute and flush stomach acid, relieving symptoms.\nTo better assess the child’s condition, I suggest measuring the child’s temperature to check for fever. In addition, continue to observe changes in symptoms; if nighttime coughing and phlegm symptoms persist or worsen, please go to the hospital promptly for a detailed examination and evaluation.\nMay I ask about the child’s diet and sleep? Are there any other accompanying symptoms (such as poor appetite, tiredness, etc.)?\n\n[Patient] The child’s appetite and sleep are still good; no other symptoms. Doctor, I will pay attention to these things you mentioned.",

      "problem_en": "Pancoast tumor, also called apical lung cancer, and also known as “Pancoast syndrome,” is located at the apex of the lung. Early symptoms include neck, shoulder, and upper arm pain, often compressing the cervical sympathetic nerves and causing ipsilateral pupil constriction. If the brachial plexus is compressed, it readily causes severe pain in the ipsilateral shoulder joint and the inner aspect of the upper limb. In the early stage, due to the lack of cough, sputum production, or hemoptysis—common respiratory symptoms of lung cancer—clinical diagnosis is easily misdiagnosed as shoulder periarthritis. If a patient develops gradually worsening shoulder-arm pain, acupuncture, physical therapy, massage, and other therapies may all be ineffective; relief after taking analgesics should alert to the possibility of a Pancoast tumor.\n\nThe area above the apex of the lung is the thoracic inlet, in proximity to many nerve roots and nerves. When a tumor arises in the periphery of the apical region, it directly compresses or invades nerves, producing symptoms similar to shoulder periarthritis, such as swelling, enlargement, and pain of the shoulder joint, with radiating pain from the shoulder and arm along the inner aspect of the arm down to the elbow and little finger, which may be accompanied by weakness of the upper limb and sensory disturbances (e.g., inability to raise the arm). Metastasis is prone to occur. When shoulder pain is present, many cases are in the mid-to-late stage upon examination.\n\nAfter a diagnosis of Pancoast cancer is confirmed, if the mass is small, there is no distant metastasis, and there is no lymph node metastasis, surgical treatment is the first choice. If it is advanced Pancoast cancer, only palliative treatment can be performed, such as interventional embolization therapy, which may shrink the mass, slow its growth, and extend survival. Depending on the condition, traditional Chinese medicine therapies may be used to improve the patient’s own anti-disease capacity.\n\nWhen there is shoulder pain of unknown cause that cannot be relieved after treatment, one should not underestimate it. In general, is it shoulder periarthritis or Pancoast cancer? Go to the hospital to take a chest X-ray and perform a chest CT to make a definitive diagnosis, and do not delay treatment.",

      "problem_en": "Osteosarcoma (osteogenic sarcoma) is a malignant bone tumor characterized by tumor cells directly producing bone-like tissue. Osteosarcoma tends to occur in adolescents; the common sites are the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus metaphyses. It often forms a spindle-shaped tumor mass that may involve the periosteum, the bone cortex, and the medullary cavity; the lesion cross-section is fish-flesh–like, brown-red or gray-red in color.\n\nThe main symptoms of osteosarcoma are local pain, mostly persistent and gradually worsening, worse at night. It may be accompanied by a local lump, restricted movement of nearby joints, increased surface skin temperature, and venous engorgement, etc.\n\nThe incidence of bone tumors itself is low, but among primary malignant bone tumors, osteosarcoma is relatively common, with about 4–5 cases per million people per year.\n\nPrimary osteosarcoma occurs more frequently in adolescents, most commonly between ages 10–20, with about 60% of patients diagnosed at age 25 or younger.\n\nIn Western countries, about 30% of patients are diagnosed at age over 40, most of whom are secondary osteosarcomas due to Paget’s disease.\n\nMale incidence is higher than female; the male-to-female incidence ratio is about 3:2.\n\nTypical symptoms of osteosarcoma: In the early stage, the most common symptoms are pain and swelling; early pain is often intermittent. Because the onset age of osteosarcoma is largely between 10–20 years, it is often confused with growing pains in adolescents, which may delay diagnosis. As the disease progresses, the pain intensifies and often becomes persistent, worse at night; rest, immobilization, and ordinary analgesics may not relieve it. Subsequently, a mass can be felt at the pain site, and nearby joints may have limited movement. On physical examination, a localized mass with tenderness can be observed. In the progressive stage, local swelling and venous engorgement are common.\n\nOsteosarcoma should first be seen in bone tumor specialists or medical oncology. If the initial site is in the oral cavity, orbital region, etc., it can be examined by dentistry/oral medicine and ophthalmology before referral to medical oncology or the bone tumor department.\n\nImaging examinations for osteosarcoma include the following aspects:\n1. X-ray examination; osteolysis, periosteal reaction, and irregular new bone may be present in osteosarcoma patients.\n2. CT examination; possible findings include bone destruction, and the degree of mineralization within the tumor. CT enhancement can reveal the tumor’s vascularity and the relationship between the tumor and vessels.\n3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination; can be used to assess the extent of soft tissue invasion by osteosarcoma.\n4. Radionuclide bone scan; osteosarcoma shows radiotracer uptake on radionuclide bone scans, with certain advantages in the qualitative assessment and localization of the tumor.\n5. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT); for early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the tumor.",

      "problem_en": "What are the etiologies of sialadenitis?\nThe etiology of sialadenitis is fairly complex; common causes are viral, bacterial, or specific infections (the three major classifications of sialadenitis). In addition, factors such as radiation, allergens, degenerative changes, and IgG4-related factors can also lead to sialadenitis. The etiologies of specific diseases are as follows:\nAcute suppurative parotitis: The main pathogen causing infection is Staphylococcus aureus. The following situations predispose to acute suppurative parotitis: ① Severe systemic diseases, such as septicemia or acute infectious diseases; ② Especially severe metabolic disturbances, such as after major abdominal surgery; ③ Injury to the parotid region and acute inflammatory spread to adjacent tissues. When the above conditions are present, the body's immunity and oral mucosal immunity are both reduced; high fever, dehydration, and reduced intake cause a decline in chewing function, leading to decreased salivary secretion in the oral cavity, increased intraoral inflammations such as dental caries, and pathogenic bacteria in the mouth can easily ascend retrograde into the salivary glands to trigger infection.\nChronic obstructive sialadenitis: Common causes include eruption of wisdom teeth and scar contraction caused by mucosal injury from poorly fitted dentures. During an attack there is mild pain; some patients wake up with swelling of the parotid region, a slight massage leads to a salty liquid flowing from the duct opening, and the local area then feels somewhat relieved.\nChronic relapsing sialadenitis: The etiology is not yet clear; it may be the result of multifactorial interactions. Parotid gland hypoplasia is a potential etiologic factor; in addition, immunodeficiency and retrograde bacterial infection can also contribute to its development.\nEpidemic parotitis (mumps): The pathogen is the paramyxovirus; it can be transmitted via respiratory droplets containing saliva. It mainly presents with fever and parotid swelling.\nCytomegalic inclusion disease: The pathogen is cytomegalovirus.\nAIDS-related salivary gland disease—cystic lymphoid hyperplasia: Caused by HIV.\nSalivary gland tuberculosis: Primarily due to tuberculosis infection of lymph nodes in the parotid region; routes of infection include hematogenous, lymphatic, and retrograde infection via ducts.\nActinomycosis: The pathogenesis is that when host resistance is low, bacteria hidden in carious cavities or tonsils ascend retrograde to cause infection.",

Depending on the extent of involvement, it is divided into centrilobular type, panlobular type, and paraseptal type.\n\nCentrilobular type presents as dilation of the central respiratory bronchioles of the alveolar sacs. It is the most common, seen mainly in middle-aged and older smokers or those with a history of chronic bronchitis;\n\nPanlobular type presents as dilation of the entire alveolar acinus. It is common in young adults and in patients with congenital (serum α1-antitrypsin) α1-AT deficiency;\n\nParaseptal type presents as dilation of the distal alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs adjacent to the septa. It is common in young adults; this type often does not accompany chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nInterstitial emphysema: is a form of emphysema caused by rupture of the terminal bronchioles or alveolar septa, allowing gas to enter the lung interstitium; it is commonly seen in rib fractures and penetrating chest injuries.\n\nOther types of emphysema include scar-associated emphysema, compensatory emphysema, and senile emphysema.\n\nThe emphysema we usually refer to is obstructive emphysema, which is also the most common.",

They are generally effective and have no side effects. Specifically include:\n- Bladder training: delaying urination, gradually increasing the volume voided per episode to more than 300 mL. For low-compliance bladders, those with end-fill detrusor pressure greater than 40 cm H2O are not suitable.\n- Timed voiding: for severe urinary incontinence and difficult control, can reduce episodes of incontinence and improve quality of life. Not suitable for those with severe urinary frequency.\n- Pelvic floor muscle training: through specific exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles and urethral sphincter.\n- Healthy weight: if you're overweight, weight loss may relieve symptoms. If you also have stress urinary incontinence, weight loss may help.\n\nPharmacotherapy:\n- First-line medications: Tolterodine, Trospium, Solifenacin; the principles of these drugs are as follows:\nBy antagonizing muscarinic receptors, they inhibit detrusor contractions, improve bladder sensory function, and suppress unstable detrusor contractions, which may also be an important mechanism. The high selectivity for the bladder is the main basis for these drugs to be used as first-line therapies. This allows these drugs to maintain efficacy while minimizing side effects.\n- Other optional drugs:\n- Other muscarinic receptor antagonists: Oxybutynin, Propiverine, Propantheline, etc. These drugs also act on muscarinic receptors outside the bladder, so side effects are relatively more noticeable.\n- Sedatives/anxiolytics: Imipramine, Desipramine, Diazepam, etc.\n- Calcium channel blockers: Verapamil, Nifedipine.\n- Prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors: Diclofenac.\n- Neuromodulation: Sacral neuromodulation therapy, effective for some refractory patients with urinary frequency/urgency and urge incontinence.\nSurgery:\n- Indications: Only applicable to severe low-compliance bladder, small bladder capacity, and risk to upper urinary tract function, after other treatments have failed.\n- Surgical methods: There are procedures such as detrusor transection, but they are currently used less frequently.\nOther treatments:\n- Botulinum toxin type A detrusor multi-point injections: effective for severe detrusor instability.\n- Bladder instillation with RTX, hyaluronidase, capsaicin; these substances may participate in bladder afferent signaling; after instillation they reduce bladder afferent signaling and may be trialed for those with severe bladder hypersensitivity.",

      "problem_en": "The English name for aspirin is Aspirin, and its chemical constituent is acetylsalicylic acid. As a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), aspirin has an extremely broad range of applications and is one of the classics in medical history. Since the late 19th century when it was developed and marketed by the German company Bayer, it has withstood a century of winds and currents. This article aims to provide readers with a comprehensive and in-depth aspirin science guide by exploring its daily uses, adverse effects, and other aspects, helping everyone better understand and use this medication.\n\nDaily Uses of Aspirin\n\nFirst, as a capable helper in pain management, aspirin demonstrates outstanding efficacy in relieving chronic, long-term pain. It precisely targets common pain symptoms such as headaches and joint pain, reducing the transmission of pain signals in the body and bringing noticeably increased comfort to patients.\n\nWhen a cold or fever strikes, aspirin becomes a “fever-fighting guardian,” and with its unique physiological mechanism—vasodilation and promoting sweating—it effectively helps the body lower its temperature, rapidly alleviating feverish discomfort.\n\nIn protecting joint health, aspirin also plays a significant role. Although it cannot directly cure the root causes of arthritis and rheumatic pains, its marked pain-relieving ability allows for freer joint movement, greatly improving patients’ quality of life.\n\nMoreover, aspirin is hailed as a “clot-buster,” with a particularly notable role in preventing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. By preventing the formation of small clots in the blood, aspirin effectively protects the heart and vessels, greatly reducing the risk of stroke, deep vein thrombosis after major surgery, pulmonary embolism, and other serious complications.\n\nAdditionally, aspirin shows unique importance in the treatment of Kawasaki disease. It can effectively reduce inflammatory responses in Kawasaki disease patients and prevent intravascular thrombosis, building a solid defense for heart and vascular health.\n\nBut aspirin’s magic does not stop there. Studies suggest it may have potential in preventing certain cancers and may have positive effects on protecting the eyes. At the same time, aspirin can also lessen some of the ear-related adverse effects of antibiotics and, to a certain extent, help prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. For people with diabetes, aspirin is an effective tool for reducing complication risk.\n\nDose Guidelines for Antithrombotic Use\n\nIn the early management of an acute myocardial infarction, rapidly chewing and swallowing a 300 mg aspirin enteric-coated tablet at onset is crucial and can significantly reduce mortality by about 23%. If used in combination with early thrombolytic therapy, the reduction in mortality risk can rise to 40%–50%. Subsequently, once the condition stabilizes, patients should transition to a long-term low-dose regimen of 75–150 mg daily. For special cases such as aspirin-resistant patients, doctors may consider adjusting the dose to between 100 and 300 mg.\n\nSimilarly, in atrial fibrillation prevention strategies, for patients under 65 years old with no organic heart disease and with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, doctors typically recommend a daily 300 mg aspirin enteric-coated tablet to effectively prevent stroke.\n\nIn addition, in the maintenance phase after arterial vascular surgery or interventional procedures, to prevent thrombosis and safeguard surgical outcomes, aspirin enteric-coated tablets are also indispensable. Patients are advised to take 100 mg daily to continuously protect vascular health and promote postoperative recovery. These examples illustrate the key role of aspirin enteric-coated tablets in managing different cardiovascular diseases.\n\nIn-depth Analysis of Aspirin Enteric-Coated Tablets\n\nFirst, aspirin enteric-coated tablets differ significantly from ordinary tablets in formulation. The enteric-coated tablet has an acid-resistant membrane on the outer layer, which remains intact in the stomach and releases the drug in the small intestine, significantly reducing gastric irritation. Ordinary tablets, by contrast, directly irritate the GI tract and are recommended to be taken after meals.\n\nSecond, when taking aspirin enteric-coated tablets, dosing details are crucial. It is recommended to take them 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals, and to drink an appropriate amount of warm water to shorten the drug’s residence time in the stomach and reduce the risk of premature release. Taking it on an empty stomach in the morning is most effective.\n\nNext, to ensure the enteric-coated tablet’s effectiveness, patients should swallow it whole, avoiding crushing, breaking, or chewing, to protect its enteric properties and ensure safe release in the small intestine.\n\nFurthermore, the safety and effectiveness of aspirin therapy heavily depend on adhering to medical orders. The dosing regimen prescribed by the physician based on individual circumstances is key to balancing efficacy and risk. Patients should strictly follow the physician’s instructions and avoid adjusting the dose on their own.\n\nFinally, during the course of treatment, avoid adverse habits, especially drinking alcohol around the time of taking the medication, to prevent increased gastric injury and prolonged bleeding time. Maintaining healthy lifestyle habits can help improve the therapeutic effect.\n\nMain Adverse Reactions\n\nAspirin, while widely used, is also associated with a range of potential effects on the gastrointestinal tract, hematologic system, allergic reactions, central nervous system, liver, heart, and kidneys. Specifically, it commonly causes nausea, vomiting, and upper abdominal discomfort, and in severe cases can lead to gastric ulcers and gastric bleeding, presenting as black stools and anemia. Therefore, it is recommended to take after meals or in combination with antacids. Those with a history of ulcers should use with caution; drugs such as misoprostol can effectively prevent ulcer occurrence.\n\nAspirin can also cause bleeding, including purpura, ecchymosis, gingival bleeding, and bleeding in various systems including the urinary and reproductive systems, and even intracranial hemorrhage. Be vigilant for early warning signs such as gum bleeding and skin bruising. Certain populations may experience allergic reactions after taking aspirin, including rashes, swelling, urticaria, and asthma; severe cases can lead to shock, especially common in middle-aged individuals and those with rhinitis or nasal polyps. Asthmatics tend to have more severe and persistent symptoms, often requiring steroid treatment.\n\nHigh doses of aspirin can also trigger central nervous system abnormalities, such as headache, dizziness, tinnitus, and progressive hearing and vision impairment due to salicylate reactions; in severe cases it can cause mental confusion, seizures, and even coma, though stopping the drug can lead to recovery. It can also provoke central nausea and vomiting.\n\nIn terms of liver effects, long-term or high-dose aspirin can cause covert liver injury, presenting as right upper abdominal discomfort and elevated enzyme levels; stopping the drug and supportive treatment usually leads to rapid improvement. While aspirin generally does not directly affect white blood cells, platelets, hematocrit, or hemoglobin, long-term use may induce iron-deficiency anemia and affect the hematologic system to some extent.\n\nAt therapeutic doses, aspirin has no significant direct effect on the cardiovascular system; however, high-dose use may act on vascular smooth muscle causing peripheral vasodilation. Toxic doses may suppress circulatory function through direct and central vascular motor paralysis, resulting in cardiotoxicity.\n\nAspirin can also cause kidney damage, manifested as drug-induced nephropathy, such as renal papillary necrosis and interstitial fibrosis, which warrants high attention.\n\nIn summary, patients using aspirin should be fully aware of its potential adverse effects and use the drug rationally under medical supervision.",

      "problem_en": "The patient, a 49-year-old female, was admitted for “palpitations, diaphoresis for 1 week, aggravated with vomiting and shortness of breath for 4 days.” One week prior, the patient developed palpitations and diaphoresis without obvious cause, accompanied by loss of appetite and malaise, intermittent fever and cough. She self-treated with antipyretic–analgesic and anti-inflammatory therapy, with no relief. Four days ago the above symptoms worsened, presenting with dyspnea, cough with white sputum, repeated vomiting; she sought care at a local hospital. Chest and abdominal CT showed bilateral pleural effusions, gallbladder stones, cholecystitis, and pelvic effusion. Laboratory tests showed elevated troponin and leukocytosis (see investigations). The clinicians considered acute cholecystitis and heart failure, and treated symptomatically with anti-inflammatory, gastric protective, and measures to improve heart function, but the symptoms did not improve significantly. Three days ago she was transferred to our department’s emergency department. Troponin remained elevated; arterial blood gas analysis indicated respiratory failure; ECG showed low voltage in the limb leads; leads V1–V3 demonstrated a QS pattern, with flattened or inverted T waves. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle myocardium, mildly elevated pulmonary artery pressure, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at rest. Given the high likelihood of acute myocardial infarction with heart failure, anti-platelet therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, vasodilators, and therapies to improve cardiac function were administered. The symptoms improved, but the patient continued to have intermittent cough with yellow sputum, occasional pink sputum; mild edema of the lower extremities; no vomiting or fever. For systematic diagnosis and treatment, she was admitted with “coronary heart disease (acute myocardial infarction?), heart failure.”\n\nDuring the illness, occasional right upper quadrant and epigastric pain occurred; no dizziness or headache; no cessation of flatus or defecation; no hematemesis or melena; intermittent hunger; appetite improved currently; sleep satisfactory; no nocturnal dyspnea; bowel and bladder function normal; no significant recent weight change.\n\nPast medical history: Hypertension for 2 years, with highest blood pressure 145/100 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); on amlodipine besilate prolonged-release tablets and telmisartan, with blood pressure controlled. History of appendectomy >10 years ago. Denies diabetes mellitus; denies tuberculosis or other infectious diseases; denies major trauma; no smoking or alcohol use. Uncle has coronary heart disease; aunt has cerebrovascular disease. On admission, examination: Temperature 36.5°C, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, blood pressure 101/85 mmHg, heart rate 90 bpm; general condition satisfactory; cooperative; mental status clear. Auscultation of the lung bases revealed slightly decreased breath sounds; no obvious dry or moist rales. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations otherwise unremarkable. Abdomen soft; mild tenderness beneath the xiphoid process and in the right upper quadrant on deep palpation; no rebound or guarding; other abdominal examinations unremarkable. Bilateral lower limbs with slight edema. Neurological examination unremarkable.\n\n3. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis\nThe patient presented with palpitations and diaphoresis as the initial symptoms; electrocardiography showed anterior wall ST-T changes; cardiac troponin was elevated; echocardiography demonstrated regional myocardial wall motion abnormalities. Therefore, the clinical initial diagnosis favored is: coronary heart disease with myocardial infarction. The main differential diagnoses include:\n\nFirst, differentiation from acute myocarditis:\n1) Etiology differs; myocarditis is often related to infection or autoimmune factors, whereas myocardial infarction is more commonly related to exertion, emotional stress, or cold exposure.\n2) Affected populations: myocarditis risk is highest across all ages in younger individuals; males are more prone than females; other groups with relatively weaker immune systems, recent viral infections, or recent fatigue or heavy exercise are more prone to myocarditis; whereas myocardial infarction occurs mainly in middle-aged or older adults, often with risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking.\n3) Symptoms: myocarditis often presents with fever, chest tightness, and respiratory symptoms; myocardial infarction presents with sudden substernal chest pain or a squeezing/burning sensation.\n4) Laboratory and imaging findings: myocarditis shows rapid evolution on ECG, most commonly ST-T changes that often resolve with recovery, and ST elevations are typically local. Myocardial infarction shows longer evolution on ECG, with eventual pathological Q waves and more extensive ST elevations. Troponin rises within 4–6 hours and lasts about 7–10 days; severe myocarditis may last longer than 14 days. Because etiologies, physical state, and severity differ among patients, the decline in myocardial enzymes can vary. Coronary angiography can confirm myocardial infarction; myocarditis can be confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy (EMB, gold standard) or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR).\n\nSecond, differentiation from stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy:\nStress cardiomyopathy refers to transient regional myocardial dysfunction triggered by severe psychological or physical stress, presenting as an acute coronary syndrome. Differentiation can be made using echocardiography, ECG, and coronary angiography; characteristic apical ballooning on echocardiography is diagnostic, and a preceding clear history of severe stress is supportive. In this patient, the absence of these key diagnostic features argues against this diagnosis.\n\nThird, differentiation from other diseases causing myocardial injury:\nAutoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, dermatomyositis, and scleroderma can cause myocardial injury. However, these conditions typically involve multiple organs with other organ involvement, which is not supported by this patient’s clinical presentation and investigations.\n\nThe patient was subjected to several diagnoses at different times during the course. When did they occur, and what were they? Finally, what should the patient’s final diagnosis be? If a definite diagnosis cannot be determined, please state that the final diagnosis cannot be determined and provide the reasons.",

She is from the mother’s first pregnancy and first delivery, with a gestational age of 34+1 weeks. Because the mother had a history of cerebellar atrophy and anemia, and there was a history of polyhydramnios and fetal growth restriction during pregnancy, with fetal distress leading to cesarean delivery. Birth weight was 1890 g, with a nuchal cord. Placenta and membranes were normal. Apgar scores were 7 at 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes. After birth, she had respiratory distress and was transferred to the neonatology department with positive-pressure ventilation and oxygen via a T-piece resuscitator. Physical examination: premature appearance, pale skin; liver palpable 2.0 cm below the right costal margin; epigastric region 1.5 cm below the xiphoid process; soft; spleen palpable 1.0 cm below the left costal margin; soft. On admission, hemoglobin 38 g/L; hematocrit 14.7%; total bilirubin 14.5 μmol/L; direct bilirubin 5.1 μmol/L. The mother’s blood type is AB positive (Rh(D) positive); during pregnancy serologic blood typing was not performed; no history of transfusion; no family history of hereditary disease. The infant’s blood type is A positive (Rh(D) positive); direct antiglobulin test (DAT) 2+, indicating immune hemolysis. The first transfusion of O type Rh(D) negative washed red blood cells was matched successfully; at 5 hours after birth transfusion was given to correct anemia, and intravenous immunoglobulin 1 g/kg was administered to block hemolytic reactions. After transfusion, hemoglobin 117 g/L; hematocrit 38%. At 12 hours after birth, total bilirubin 122 μmol/L; phototherapy started. At 24 hours after birth, hemoglobin 105 g/L; hematocrit 33.15%; another attempt to crossmatch with O-negative washed red blood cells failed; crossmatch with A type Rh(D) positive leukocyte-reduced red cell suspension was successful; another transfusion given. After transfusion, hemoglobin 155 g/L; hematocrit 47.2%. At 60 hours after birth, total serum bilirubin 189 μmol/L; phototherapy restarted. Center blood bank results: the infant’s direct antiglobulin test with polyspecific anti-human globulin was positive, anti-IgG test positive, anti-C3d test positive; eluate test detected anti-Jk^b antibody; release test detected anti-Jk^b antibody. Anti-Jk^b antibody detected in the mother’s serum. It was confirmed that the infant had neonatal hemolysis caused by anti-Jk^b antibodies. Thereafter bilirubin monitoring never reached phototherapy thresholds; at 12 days after birth repeat direct antiglobulin test was negative. The infant remained in hospital for continued treatment due to prematurity-associated complications such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and was discharged cured on day 18 of life.

Anthracyclines (including doxorubicin, epirubicin, aclarubicin, and daunorubicin, etc.) are widely used in the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic systems (such as leukemia, breast cancer, and lymphoma) and are the most common chemotherapeutic drugs that cause cardiotoxic injury; clinical data show they can cause progressive, irreversible cardiotoxic damage. Cardiotoxicity can manifest as palpitations, electrocardiogram abnormalities, and a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (Left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF); in severe cases, congestive heart failure (CHF) can occur. Most CHF cases occur within 1 year after anthracycline therapy, but a minority appear several years after chemotherapy ends. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) states that children treated with anthracyclines, even if temporarily asymptomatic, are at high risk for long-term heart failure. Cardiotoxic injury due to anticancer therapy accounts for 30%–50% of cancer deaths and includes acute or subacute cardiotoxicity, chronic cardiotoxicity, and delayed-onset cardiotoxicity. Electrocardiography and the cardiac enzyme panel are currently routine clinical tests, but lack specificity. LVEF is a commonly used marker for screening cardiotoxicity; however, LVEF is very insensitive to subclinical cardiotoxicity, often underestimating the extent of cardiac injury and cannot be used for early cardiotoxicity detection.",

For the past 3 months there had been intermittent, tolerable upper abdominal distension pain without obvious etiologies, not radiating to other sites, more noticeable after meals, relieved by abdominal palpation, with no clear pain pattern; symptoms recurred. Over 3 months weight loss of about 5 kg. No nausea, vomiting, melena, or back pain. She did not seek medical care at that time. One day prior she visited a provincial government hospital; gastroscopy showed “gastric antral giant ulcerative infiltrative lesion,” suspected gastric cancer. She was referred to our hospital; outpatient diagnosis suggested “gastric antral cancer?” and was admitted. Past history noncontributory.\n\nAdmission examination: alert and oriented; superficial lymph nodes not enlarged. Clear breath sounds bilaterally; regular heart rhythm; no edema of the lower limbs. Specialist assessment: general condition acceptable; conjunctiva not pallid; sclera not icteric; no palpable supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Abdomen soft and flat; no palpable mass; no abdominal tenderness or rebound tenderness; liver and spleen not palpable below costal margins. Shifting dullness negative. Bowel sounds 4–5/min. Digital rectal examination (lithotomy position): rectal mucosa smooth; no palpable mass; prostate Grade II enlarged, firm, smooth, no nodules; digital examination glove without blood.\n\nPostadmission gastroscopy pathology report (No: 100×××) showed mucinous adenocarcinoma; corresponding paraffin sections sent for pathology consultation (Consultation No: H20100xxx): mucinous adenocarcinoma. Further evaluations: complete blood count, biochemical profile, coagulation tests without obvious abnormalities; electrocardiogram: essentially normal; chest radiograph: increased bronchovascular markings and thickening; mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine; abdominal ultrasound: benign prostatic hyperplasia; liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys without abnormal findings. Upper abdominal CT: mild thickening of the gastric wall at the antral region; the gastrohepatic space contained multiple small lymph node shadows.\n\nPreoperative assessment showed no contraindication to surgery. On 20xx.5.10 under general anesthesia, underwent “radical distal gastrectomy with Billroth I reconstruction, D2+ lymphadenectomy, R0 resection.” Intraoperatively a 3 cm × 3 cm × 2 cm ulcerated tumor was palpable on the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum, invading the serosa. Postoperative treatment included antibiotics (cefadmin? Cefamandole sodium) and metronidazole for infection, acid suppression, hemostasis, fluid and electrolyte replenishment, nutritional support, immune-enhancement, and humidified airway therapy for sputum clearance. The patient recovered well; incision healing grade II/II; gastrointestinal function recovered; tolerating semi-fluid diet; appetite good; regular bowel movements; afebrile; no abdominal pain or distension.\n\nPostoperative pathology (No: xxx5xx) showed: antral lesser curvature ulcerative-type tubular adenocarcinoma, Grade II, with areas of mucinous adenocarcinoma; vascular invasion with tumor emboli; serosal invasion. The proximal and distal margins were free of tumor infiltration; lymph node assessment found small curvature lymph nodes 1/6 positive; greater curvature lymph nodes 1/3 positive; pyloric region upper lymph nodes 2/2 positive; pyloric region lower lymph nodes 0/10 negative; additional (8 groups) lymph nodes 0/3; (9 groups) 0/3; (12 groups) 0/2; (14V group) 0/1; (16 groups) 0/1 with metastasis.

The patient is an 82-year-old woman living alone, admitted for “nearly two months of unexplained poor glycemic control.” Before admission, she was treated with insulin glargine U100 in combination with insulin aspart injections, but blood glucose rose abnormally for unknown reasons. It was later found that the fluctuations were due to a degree of medication-adherence problems, as the patient could not distinguish insulin aspart from insulin glargine, and randomly used one at each injection. Under the simplified treatment, she was switched to 德谷门冬双胰岛素 injections twice daily. After changing the treatment, insulin requirements decreased, achieving the glycemic control targets for elderly type 2 diabetes patients with moderate health status.

      "problem_en": "Toothache: The sensation of tooth pain varies with the depth of the lesion; shallow caries generally cause no pain, moderate caries may have transient pain in response to sour, sweet, cold, and hot stimuli, and deep caries can produce provoked pain, such as in response to cold or hot stimuli.\nChanges in tooth color: Diseased teeth may show color changes; shallow caries pits at the fissures become black, smooth-surface caries appear white chalky, yellow-brown, or brown spots; caries in moderate and deep lesions show dentin in the cavitated area as yellow-brown or dark brown[1].\nChanges in tooth morphology: In patients with shallow caries, the lesion is shallow, the tooth surface roughness is mildly reduced, with no tooth morphology changes; in moderate caries cavitation can be seen, the tooth texture is softer; in deep caries the lesion has penetrated into the interior of the tooth, cavitation is visible, the tooth texture is softer.\nFood tends to get stuck: When the tooth surface has carious cavities, food tends to lodge in the cavities during eating, and is difficult to clean.\nOral odor: As it progresses to deep caries, there is frequent food impaction, leading to halitosis.\nBacterial infection: The main cause of caries is dental plaque. Dental plaque is a nearly colorless thin film on the tooth surface that contains bacteria causing caries; these bacteria produce acids, and these acids, acting over time, demineralize the tooth, thereby causing caries[1].\nDietary factors: Frequent consumption of carbohydrates, high-sugar foods that adhere to hidden parts of the teeth; bacteria in dental plaque interact chemically with the sugars or starches in foods to produce acidic substances that erode the teeth. Over time, the enamel is damaged, forming relatively fragile small pits; if it worsens, cavities form, i.e., caries[1].\nHost factors: Refers to the patient; the main factors affecting caries development include teeth and saliva. Different teeth have varying susceptibility to caries; the amount, composition, and flow rate of saliva influence the development of caries[1].\nTime factors: From bacteria adhering to the tooth surface, to forming a dental plaque biofilm, to bacteria producing organic acids that erode the tooth and cause damage, all require time. Therefore, caries is a slow, chronic process[1].\nVisual inspection: Observe the color of the patient’s teeth to see whether chalky white, yellow-brown, or brownish spots appear, and assess the extent of tooth defects; check for cavitation formation.\nExploration: Use a dental explorer to probe the depth of the cavities and the tooth’s sensitivity, etc.\nPercussion: Use a metal instrument to strike the crown horizontally or vertically to assess the status of the apex and the periodontal membrane.\nMobility: Grasp the tooth with tweezers to see if there is any mobility.\nPulpal temperature testing: Divided into cold testing and hot testing; patients with moderate and deep caries are sensitive to cold, hot, sour, and sweet stimuli, with pain more pronounced when stimulated, especially in deep caries.\nX-ray examination: Take X-ray images to help determine the location and depth of the carious cavity and its surrounding conditions.",

One week before admission, she developed palpitations and diaphoresis without an obvious trigger, accompanied by decreased appetite and malaise, with intermittent fever and cough. She self-administered antipyretic–analgesic and anti-inflammatory treatment, but symptoms did not improve. Four days prior, the above symptoms worsened with dyspnea, accompanied by cough with white sputum and repeated vomiting. She sought care at a local hospital. Chest and abdominal CT showed bilateral pleural effusions, gallstones, cholecystitis, and pelvic effusion. Laboratory tests showed elevated troponin and leukocytosis (see investigations). Considered diagnoses were acute cholecystitis and heart failure. Symptomatic treatment with anti-inflammatory therapy, gastric protection, and measures to improve cardiac function yielded no significant relief. Three days ago she was transferred to our emergency department. Troponin remained elevated; arterial blood gas analysis indicated respiratory failure; electrocardiography showed low voltage in the limb leads, QS pattern in leads V1–V3, and flattened or inverted T waves. Cardiac ultrasound showed regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle, mildly elevated pulmonary artery pressure, and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at rest. Acute myocardial infarction was considered highly likely, along with heart failure; she was treated with antiplatelet therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, vasodilators, and therapies to improve cardiac function. Symptoms improved but cough persisted intermittently, with yellow sputum, and occasional pink sputum; mild edema of the lower extremities; no vomiting or fever. For systematic diagnosis and management, she was admitted with “Coronary heart disease (acute MI?), heart failure.” On admission there was occasional right upper and middle abdominal pain, without dizziness or headache; no cessation of flatus or bowel movements; no hematemesis or melena; intermittent hunger; appetite currently improved; sleep good; no nocturnal dyspnea; bowel and bladder functions normal; no significant recent weight change. Past medical history includes hypertension for 2 years, with the highest blood pressure 145/100 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); normally on nifedipine extended-release tablets and telmisartan, with blood pressure adequately controlled.

On the 17th I went to see a doctor; the CBC showed elevated monocytes. The doctor said it was a viral infection and told me to recover from the cold and come back for a follow-up in two weeks. On recheck the monocytes decreased. I found that my eosinophils and basophils suddenly rose very high, and the platelets were higher than before.

      "problem_en": "Objective: To study the gene mutation status in two cases of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis-type ichthyosis. Methods: Skin lesions were collected for histopathology and electron microscopy; peripheral blood DNA was extracted, and mutations in the keratin 10 (KRT10, K10) and keratin 1 (KRT1, K1) genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing; allele-specific primer PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism methods were used to screen the allele frequency of these genes in the normal population. Results: Both patients had heterozygous point mutations in the keratin 1 or keratin 10 genes, i.e., G>A at nt 2140 of the KRT10 gene and G>A at nt 4226 of the KRT1 gene, which respectively lead to an arginine-to-histidine substitution at position 156 in KRT10 (R156H) and an amino acid change from glutamic acid to lysine at position 477 in KRT1 (E477K); normal controls did not show these substitutions. Conclusion: KRT10 R156H and KRT1 E477K are the specific mutations responsible for the clinical phenotypes in these two patients.\n\nBased on the above materials, can you determine which department the physician who published this paper might belong to?",

      "problem": "摘要：肝硬化并发症的管理是改善肝硬化患者临床结局的重要措施。除了关注腹水、食管胃静脉出血、肝性脑病、肝肾综合征等常见或危急并发症外，也需要关注血小板减少症、门静脉血栓形成等并发症，以期为肝硬化患者提供完整的病情评估和全面的治疗，提高其生活质量、改善其预后。有效白蛋白更有助于预测肝硬化结局，相关概念逐渐被接受，但其检测方法仍有待进一步标准化和商业化。\n\n肝硬化带来沉重的疾病负担：全球约有1.12亿代偿期肝硬化和1060万失代偿期肝硬化患者[1-2]，我国有700万肝硬化及数亿可能发展为肝硬化的高危者[3]；而代偿期和失代偿期肝硬化患者的病死率分别为普通人群的5倍和10倍[4]。改善肝硬化临床结局既要控制其病因，也要积极防治其并发症。肝硬化所致的腹水、食管胃静脉曲张破裂出血、肝性脑病、肝肾综合征和感染等并发症较常见或危急，中华医学会肝病学分会、感染病学分会、消化病学分会、消化内镜学分会等已经制定了相关指南和/或共识[5-9]。肝硬化“少见并发症”，如乳糜性腹水、血性腹水、肝性胸水、少见病原菌感染的自发性腹膜炎、肝硬化心肌病、门静脉性肺动脉高压、肝性脊髓病、获得性肝脑变性、肝硬化骨病、门静脉高压性胃病、门静脉高压性肠病等，应引起大家重视，《中华肝脏病杂志》曾组织专家撰稿梳理其临床诊治进展[10-11]，以提高其诊治水平。除此之外，还有一些肝硬化并发症[如门静脉血栓（portal vein thrombosis，PVT）、血小板减少症（thrombocytopenia，TCP）]和相关概念[如有效白蛋白（effective albumin，eAlb）]在临床上容易被忽视。\n《中华肝脏病杂志》本期的“肝硬化临床容易忽视的并发症”重点号邀请了相关领域学者撰写了系列文章。首都医科大学附属北京佑安医院丁惠国教授、首都医科大学附属北京地坛医院谢雯教授和广州医科大学附属市八医院的关玉娟教授分别就PVT[12]、eAlb检测[13]和TCP管理[14]进行了探讨。北京大学第一医院徐京杭教授团队分析了该院肝硬化住院患者合并TCP的相关因素[15]。希望本专题有助于提高读者对该领域的兴趣并提高诊疗水平。\n\n01 肝硬化的PVT防治的新靶点\nPVT指门静脉主干和/或其主要分支发生血栓，伴或不伴肠系膜静脉和脾静脉血栓形成[16]。PVT是肝硬化常见的并发症之一，抗凝治疗是其重要治疗措施之一[17-18]，但符合抗凝治疗指征的肝硬化PVT患者常面临食管胃静脉曲张破裂出血等风险，从而使抗凝治疗受阻[19-20]。因此，肝硬化PVT的抗凝治疗时机和最佳方案仍有待优化，开发新治疗靶点有重要意义[21]。丁惠国教授团队指出，靶向肠道菌群及其代谢产物的精准干预方法显示出了一定的应用潜力[12]。\n\n02 eAlb水平\n白蛋白具有维持胶体渗透压、转运多种小分子物质和抗炎等多种功能[22]。肝硬化（尤其是失代偿期）时因肝细胞合成减少和血液稀释等原因常见低白蛋白血症[6,23]。随着肝硬化的进展，除血浆总白蛋白水平下降外，结构及功能完整的eAlb水平也随之下降；与总白蛋白水平相比，入院时eAlb水平更能预测肝硬化急性失代偿患者的预后[24]。基于其在反映疾病严重程度和预测预后方面的优势，eAlb有望成为预测肝硬化结局的新指标，并可能成为指导人血白蛋白治疗的标志物。但目前尚缺乏简单统一的检测方法。谢雯教授团队指出，基于液相色谱串联质谱技术的白蛋白结构分析及基于电子顺磁共振技术的白蛋白功能分析技术具有较大的应用前景，期待其在及时性、便捷性、经济性和准确性等方面的进步，未来能够更好地指导肝硬化患者的诊疗[13]。\n\n03 肝硬化TCP\n肝硬化相关TCP是指各种病因的肝硬化患者在疾病发展过程中，因肝硬化本身或肝硬化相关治疗所致的血小板（platelet，PLT）减少，国内通常定义为PLT<100×109/L，国外研究常定义为PLT<150×109/L[14]。其发生机制包括：血小板生成素（thrombopoietin，TPO）生成减少，病毒、乙醇及药物引起骨髓抑制，PLT生成减少、PLT破坏增加、PLT消耗增加及PLT在脾脏内滞留所致分布异常等[25-28]。PLT减少时，肝硬化患者食管胃静脉曲张出血等风险明显增加，而且会限制患者进行肝病相关的手术及有创操作，从而影响肝硬化患者的诊疗。\n在北京大学第一医院2 517例住院肝硬化患者中有57%合并TCP[15]，其数值尽管较既往国外研究（76%[29]和64%[30]）低，但仍足以说明TCP很常见。与TCP最相关的因素是脾功能亢进。此外，女性较男性的TCP率更高、合并食管胃静脉曲张者TCP率更高。TCP影响了有创操作的开展并与不良结局相关，提示积极管理TCP的必要性[15]。\nPLT还可能有助于抑制肝纤维化、促进肝细胞再生和改善肝功能[31]，且有研究结果显示PLT输注后慢性肝病及肝硬化患者肝功能改善[32]。考虑到PLT制品的紧缺性和无效输注的风险，值得探讨重组人TPO[33]和TPO受体激动剂[34]等升PLT药物是否有助于改善肝硬化结局的问题。\n总之，管理肝硬化患者时不仅要关注常见和危急的并发症，也不能忽视其他“少见”或非危急的并发症。临床工作中应力求为肝硬化患者提供完整的病情评估和全面的治疗，提高其生活质量，改善其预后。\n\n仔细阅读文章，将提到的所有数据进行分类，还需要根据文章中提到的两种类型肝硬化情况进行不同点和相同点分类，以表格形式输出。",

      "problem_en": "Abstract: The management of complications in cirrhosis is an important measure to improve clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis. In addition to focusing on common or critical complications such as ascites, esophagogastric variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome, attention should also be paid to complications such as thrombocytopenia and portal vein thrombosis, with the aim of providing a comprehensive assessment of the illness and comprehensive treatment for patients with cirrhosis to improve their quality of life and prognosis. Effective albumin is more helpful in predicting cirrhosis outcomes; the related concept has been gradually accepted, but its detection methods still require further standardization and commercialization.\n\nCirrhosis imposes a heavy disease burden: globally, about 112 million patients with compensated cirrhosis and 10.6 million with decompensated cirrhosis [1-2], China has 7 million cirrhosis patients and hundreds of millions at high risk of developing cirrhosis [3]; while the mortality of compensated and decompensated cirrhosis patients is 5-fold and 10-fold higher than that of the general population, respectively [4]. Improving clinical outcomes in cirrhosis requires both controlling its etiologies and actively preventing and treating its complications. Complications such as ascites, esophagogastric variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and infections due to cirrhosis are common or urgent; the Chinese Medical Association’s hepatology, infectious diseases, digestive diseases, and digestive endoscopy branches have formulated relevant guidelines and/or consensus statements [5-9]. Other “rare complications” of cirrhosis, such as chylous ascites, hemorrhagic ascites, hepatic pleural effusion, spontaneous peritonitis due to rare pathogens, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, portal hypertension–related pulmonary arterial hypertension, hepatic myelopathy, acquired hepatocerebral degeneration, cirrhotic bone disease, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and portal hypertensive enteropathy, should attract attention; the Chinese Journal of Hepatology has organized experts to review the clinical diagnostic and treatment progress to improve practice [10-11]. In addition, some cirrhosis complications [such as portal vein thrombosis (portal vein thrombosis, PVT), thrombocytopenia (thrombocytopenia, TCP)] and related concepts [such as effective albumin (effective albumin, eAlb)] are easily overlooked in clinical practice.\n\nThis issue of the Chinese Journal of Hepatology focuses on “Clinically Neglected Complications of Cirrhosis,” inviting scholars in the field to contribute a series of articles. Professors Ding Huiguo from Beijing You’an Hospital, Capital Medical University; Xie Wen from Beijing Ditan Hospital affiliated with Capital Medical University; and Guan Yajuan from the Sixth Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University discuss PVT [12], eAlb detection [13], and TCP management [14], respectively. Professor Xu Jinghang’s team at Peking University First Hospital analyzed factors related to TCP in their hospitalized cirrhosis patients [15]. It is hoped that this theme section will help raise readers’ interest in the field and improve diagnostic and therapeutic practices.\n\n01 New targets for the prevention and treatment of PVT in cirrhosis\nPVT refers to thrombosis of the portal vein trunk and/or its major branches, with or without thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein [16]. PVT is one of the common complications of cirrhosis, and anticoagulation is an important treatment measure [17-18], but cirrhotic patients with PVT who meet anticoagulation indications often face risks such as esophagogastric variceal bleeding, which can hinder anticoagulation therapy [19-20]. Therefore, the timing and optimal regimen of anticoagulation for cirrhotic PVT remain to be optimized, and developing new therapeutic targets is of important significance [21]. Professor Ding Huiguo’s team points out that precise interventions targeting the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites show certain application potential [12].\n\n02 eAlb levels\nAlbumin has multiple functions, including maintaining colloid osmotic pressure, transporting various small molecules, and anti-inflammatory effects [22]. In cirrhosis (especially in the decompensated stage), hypoalbuminemia is common due to decreased hepatocyte synthesis and plasma dilution [6,23]. As cirrhosis progresses, in addition to a decline in total plasma albumin, structurally and functionally intact effective albumin (eAlb) also decreases; compared with total albumin, admission eAlb levels better predict prognosis in patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis [24]. Based on its advantages in reflecting disease severity and predicting prognosis, eAlb is expected to become a new indicator for predicting cirrhosis outcomes and may serve as a marker to guide human albumin therapy. However, simple and unified detection methods are still lacking. Professor Xie Wen’s team notes that albumin structural analysis based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and albumin functional analysis based on electron paramagnetic resonance have substantial potential applications, and they look forward to advancements in timeliness, convenience, cost-effectiveness, and accuracy to better guide the diagnosis and treatment of cirrhotic patients in the future [13].\n\n03 Cirrhosis-associated thrombocytopenia\nCirrhosis-associated TCP refers to decreased platelets in the course of cirrhosis due to cirrhosis itself or cirrhosis-related treatments; domestically, it is typically defined as PLT < 100 × 10^9/L, while international studies often define PLT < 150 × 10^9/L [14]. Its mechanisms include reduced thrombopoietin (TPO) production, bone marrow suppression due to viruses, alcohol, and drugs, decreased platelet production, increased platelet destruction, increased platelet consumption, and abnormal distribution due to splenic sequestration [25-28]. When platelets are reduced, the risk of esophagogastric variceal bleeding in cirrhosis increases markedly, and it may limit liver-disease-related surgeries and invasive procedures, thereby affecting the diagnosis and treatment of cirrhosis patients. Among 2,517 hospitalized cirrhosis patients at Peking University First Hospital, 57% had TCP [15]. Although this figure is lower than in previous foreign studies (76% [29] and 64% [30]), it still demonstrates that TCP is very common. The most closely associated factor with TCP is hypersplenism. Additionally, TCP is more prevalent in women than men, and higher in those with esophagogastric varices. TCP affects the conduct of invasive procedures and is associated with adverse outcomes, underscoring the need for proactive management of TCP [15].\n\nPLT may also help suppress liver fibrosis, promote hepatocyte regeneration, and improve liver function [31], and studies have shown that platelet transfusion can improve liver function in patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis [32]. Given the scarcity of platelet products and the risk of ineffective transfusion, it is worth exploring whether platelet-raising therapies such as recombinant human TPO [33] and TPO receptor agonists [34] could help improve cirrhosis outcomes.\n\nIn summary, when managing patients with cirrhosis, clinicians should not only focus on common and critical complications but also pay attention to other “rare” or non-urgent complications. Clinical practice should strive to provide a comprehensive assessment of the patient’s condition and comprehensive treatment for cirrhosis to improve quality of life and prognosis.\n\nCarefully read the article, classify all data mentioned, and also categorize the differences and similarities between the two types of cirrhosis mentioned in the article, output in tabular form.",

Transferred to hepatobiliary surgery for treatment of liver abscess.\n\n【Subsequent diagnosis and treatment】On hospital day 7, under ultrasound guidance a repeat liver abscess puncture was performed, extracting about 10 mL of gray-white purulent secretions. After day 9, color Doppler ultrasound showed: in the left inner lobe of the liver a lesion 6.8 cm × 4.0 cm in size, with heterogeneous strong echo mass, accompanied by honeycomb-shaped fluid-dark areas. Bacterial culture showed no growth. Considering the patient’s long medical history, although two ultrasound-guided punctures with drainage were performed, the abscess remained incompletely liquefied; enhanced CT and MRI suggested possible hepatocellular carcinoma, thus liver cancer with liquefactive necrosis could not be excluded, and surgical treatment was decided.\n\nIntraoperatively, there was a small amount of yellow exudate in the abdominal cavity, tissues were markedly edematous. A 6.0 cm × 4.0 cm mass was seen in the lower segment of the left inner lobe of the liver; the tissue was firm and densely adherent to the transverse colon, the duodenum, and the lesser curvature of the stomach; the tumor was completely resected along its margins. On opening the tumor, the cross-section showed honeycomb-like changes with gray-white purulent fluid flowing out. Rapid intraoperative pathology suggested hepatic abscess; postoperative pathology report: (left lobe) hepatic tissue with acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation, with bacterial colonies seen; special stains: PAS(+), PASM(+). Postoperatively, intravenous cefotetan and metronidazole were administered as part of comprehensive therapy; discharged after 19 days in hospital with full recovery.

Drugs are generally considered the major cause of death from severe allergic reactions in adults. In recent years, new eliciting drugs have gradually been recognized, including biologics such as cetuximab, small molecules or new chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., olaparib), disinfectants (e.g., chlorhexidine), pharmaceutical excipients (e.g., polyethylene glycol), and methylcellulose. Specifically in China, Singapore, and other Asian countries, severe allergic reactions induced by traditional Chinese medicine also deserve attention. Some studies report that among 150 cases of severe traditional Chinese medicine-induced allergic reactions, despite receiving emergency treatment, 21 cases (14%) died; all of these patients had received injectable traditional Chinese herbal preparations for upper respiratory tract infections. According to statistics from the China State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), from 2004 to 2007, domestic hospitals used 147 traditional Chinese medicine injections from 400 Chinese manufacturers, with annual sales exceeding US$2 billion.

We went to the hospital to get a medication, 小儿氨酚黄那敏颗粒, for 3 days. Yesterday the cough worsened; it comes on when lying down, and he cries. We had blood tests at the hospital and were told his C-reactive protein was elevated, so a medication was prescribed. Today the cough is still there and not improving. What should we do? (Male, age: 8 months)\n\n[Doctor] Hello, thank you for your detailed description. Based on the information you provided, the baby's symptoms seem to be worsening, especially the cough and crying. A high C-reactive protein suggests there may be an infection. To better understand the baby's condition, I need to ask you one question: Does the baby have a fever? If so, what is the temperature?\n\n[Patient] The baby's temperature is around 37°C.\n\n[Doctor] Okay, the baby's temperature is within the normal range, which is a good sign. Next, I need to understand the specifics of the cough. Is the cough dry or productive? If productive, what is the color and nature of the sputum?\n\n[Patient] The baby has a dry cough, no sputum.\n\n[Doctor] Understood, dry cough with no sputum. Does the cough have a temporal pattern? For example, is it worse at night or in the morning?\n\n[Patient] The cough occurs when the baby lies down, especially at night.\n\n[Doctor] Understood, coughing when lying down, especially at night. This situation may be related to **allergic cough** or **asthma**, but other possibilities should also be considered. Next, I need to learn about the baby's living environment. Are there allergens in the baby's living environment (such as dust mites, pets, pollen, etc.)?\n\n[Patient] There are no pets in the baby's living environment, and there is no obvious allergen exposure.\n\n[Doctor] Good, there are no pets and no obvious allergen exposure in the baby's living environment. Next, I need to know the baby's past medical history and family history. Does the baby have any past medical history, or is there a family history of allergic cough, asthma, or other respiratory diseases?\n\n[Patient] The baby previously had diaper dermatitis, and the aunt has allergic rhinitis.\n\n[Doctor] Understood, the baby previously had diaper dermatitis, and the aunt has allergic rhinitis, which suggests the baby may have some predisposition to allergies. Considering the baby's symptoms and history, the likelihood of **upper respiratory infection** or **allergic cough** is relatively high. Because the cough worsens, especially when lying down and at night, I recommend you bring the baby to the hospital for further examination, particularly a detailed lung auscultation and necessary imaging to rule out lower respiratory tract infections (such as bronchitis or pneumonia). May I ask whether you have already had chest radiographs or other imaging studies done for the baby?\n\n[Patient] No imaging studies have been done. So how should I determine whether it is an upper respiratory infection or an allergic cough?\n\nQuestion: What clinical findings are present in the above history-taking dialogue? What is the polarity (positive/negative) of these entities? Positive/negative options: existing symptomatic diseases or diseases expected to occur in the future, etc.; not having symptomatic disease; no answer, don't know, answer unclear or ambiguous or hard to infer; no meaningful annotation or annotation independent of the patient's current state.

I suggest you first undergo some tests, such as pulmonary function testing and chest X-ray, to rule out asthma or other lung diseases.\n\nPatient: I’ve already had the tests and was diagnosed with asthma. Previously the doctor prescribed Salbutamol, but I don’t quite understand this medication.\n\nDoctor: Salbutamol is a short-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist; it can help relax the smooth muscle of the airways, relieving wheeze and dyspnea. It is usually used during an asthma attack, and you need to use it correctly according to instructions.\n\nPatient: What about Terbutaline? I’ve heard this drug can also be used for asthma.\n\nDoctor: Yes, Terbutaline is also a β2 receptor agonist; its mechanism is similar to Salbutamol and it is used to relieve acute asthma symptoms. However, because it is in oral form, the onset may not be as fast as Salbutamol, and it is typically used for patients who cannot use inhalers or as a supplement for long-term control.\n\nPatient: I have another question: Nitroglycerin and Isosorbide Dinitrate are drugs used to treat heart disease; my father has angina. What are the differences between these drugs?\n\nDoctor: Nitroglycerin and Isosorbide Dinitrate both belong to the nitrate class; they dilate blood vessels to reduce the heart’s workload, thereby relieving angina. Nitroglycerin acts faster and is usually used for acute angina episodes as emergency treatment. Isosorbide Dinitrate is a long-acting drug used to prevent angina episodes and suitable for long-term use.\n\nPatient: I understand. Do these drugs have side effects?\n\nDoctor: Salbutamol and Terbutaline may cause palpitations, tremors, etc., while Nitroglycerin and Isosorbide Dinitrate may cause headache, hypotension, etc. If severe side effects occur, seek medical attention promptly. Be sure to follow your doctor's instructions for using these medications, and consult a doctor if you have any questions.\n\nPatient: Okay, thank you very much for your explanation.

Nebulized antibiotics are commonly used for chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in bronchiectasis and for nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. Because there are currently no formulations specifically for nebulized inhalation in China, substituting intravenous antibiotic preparations for nebulized formulations is not recommended. Some intravenous preparations contain preservatives (such as phenol, nitrites, etc.), and inhalation can trigger an episode of bronchial asthma (asthma).",

      "problem": "Between 10 and 17 April 2024, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) reported three cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including one death, to WHO. All three cases were reported in Riyadh and linked to the same health-care facility. Two of the cases were identified through contact tracing following identification of the index case. The second and third case are suspected to be secondary health care associated cases due to contact with the index case. The investigations are ongoing to verify this and understand the route of transmission.\nThe index case is a 56-year-old male school teacher, and a Saudi national residing in Riyadh. On 29 March, he developed a fever, cough, runny nose and body aches. He sought medical care at the emergency room (ER) of a hospital in Riyadh on 4 April, where case number three was also being treated. He was then admitted to a ward on 4 April, where he shared a room with case number two. On 6 April, he was transferred to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolation and intubated, was tested by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and was confirmed positive for MERS-CoV. The case had underlying health conditions, including hypertension and chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis . There was no clear history of exposure to typical MERS-CoV risk factors. Close contacts, including 20 health and care workers and seven household members, were followed up, which problemly identified the two secondary cases. Investigations, including determining the source of the infection, are still ongoing. The index case died on 7 April.\nThe second case is a retired 60-year-old male Saudi national, residing in Riyadh. He was admitted to the ICU at the same hospital in Riyadh on 8 March 2024. On 31 March, he was transferred to a ward, where he subsequently shared a room with the index case on 4 April. The case developed a fever on 6 April and tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR on 8 April. He has underlying health conditions including heart disease and being a smoker. With no history of exposure to camels, the case is suspected to be a secondary healthcare-associated case due to contact with the index case, with investigations ongoing. The follow-up of 13 health and care workers and one patient has been completed, with no additional cases identified to date. \nThe third case is a 60-year-old male, retired military personnel and Saudi national, residing in Riyadh. On 4 April, he went to the ER of the same hospital in Riyadh, where the index case was also admitted. He was then admitted to the ward (different to the one that the index case and case number two shared) on 5 April. He developed shortness of breath on 10 April and was transferred to the ICU on 15 April. He tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR on the same day. He has underlying health conditions including chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis, malignancy, and liver disease. No history of exposure to camels was identified and, like the second case, he is suspected to be a secondary healthcare-associated case due to contact with the index case. A follow-up of 14 health care workers is ongoing, with no additional cases identified to date. \nAs of 21 April 2024, the second and third cases remained in the ICU and were intubated on 9 April and 18 April, respectively.\n用表格整理下这里面提到的病历信息，包括性别、居住地、职业、症状和关键时间节点",

      "problem": "登革热（“断骨热” ）是一种从蚊子传播到人的病毒感染。在热带和亚热带气候中较为常见。大多数感染登革热的人不会出现症状。对于有症状的感染者来说，最常见的症状是高烧、头痛、身体疼痛、恶心和皮疹。大多数患者会在1-2周内好转。有些人发展为重症登革热，需要在医院接受治疗。如果是重症病例，登革热可能会致命。可以通过避免蚊虫叮咬来降低登革热风险，尤其是在白天。目前尚无登革热特异性治疗方法，可用止痛药进行治疗。近几十年来，世界各地的登革热发病率急剧上升，从2000年到2019年，向世卫组织报告的病例从505 430例增至520万例。绝大多数病例没有症状，或症状轻微，经自我管理后即可痊愈，因此，登革热病例的实际数量多于报告数量。许多病例被误诊为其他发热性疾病(1)。\n2023年记录的登革热病例数最多，影响到世卫组织所有区域的80多个国家。自2023年初以来，登革热持续传播，病例数意外激增，导致超过650万例，创历史新高，并报告了逾7300例登革热相关死亡。\n有几个因素与登革热流行病蔓延的风险增加有关：媒介（主要是埃及伊蚊和白纹伊蚊）的分布不断变化，特别是在以前没有登革热的国家；2023年厄尔尼诺现象的后果和气候变化导致气温升高、降雨增多且湿度增高；COVID-19大流行期间脆弱的卫生系统；面临复杂人道主义危机的国家的政治和金融不稳定以及人口大量流动。\n一项模型估算显示，每年有3.9亿例登革热病毒感染，其中9600万例有临床症状(2)。另一项关于登革热流行率估算的研究表明，全世界共有39亿人面临登革热病毒感染风险(3)。\n该病目前在世卫组织非洲、美洲、东地中海、东南亚和西太平洋区域100多个国家呈地方性流行。美洲、东南亚和西太平洋区域受到的影响最为严重，亚洲约占全球疾病负担的70%。登革热正在蔓延到欧洲、东地中海和南美洲的新地区。2023年是报告登革热病例最多的一年。世卫组织美洲区域报告了450万例病例，其中2300例死亡。亚洲报告的病例数量较多：孟加拉国（321 000例）、马来西亚（111 400例）、泰国（150 000例）和越南（369 000例）。\n登革热病毒通过已感染雌蚊（主要是埃及伊蚊）的叮咬传播给人类。其他种类的伊蚊也可以成为病媒，但影响通常次于埃及伊蚊。然而，2023年，欧洲出现了由白纹伊蚊（虎蚊）导致的登革热本地传播激增情况。\n吸食感染者的血液后，病毒在蚊子的中肠内复制，然后扩散到包括唾液腺在内的次生组织。从摄食病毒到实际传播给新宿主所需的时间称为外潜伏期。当环境温度在25-28°C之间时，外潜伏期大约需要8-12天。外潜伏期的变化不仅受环境温度的影响；若干其它因素，例如每日温度波动幅度、病毒基因型和初始病毒浓度也可以改变蚊子传播病毒所需的时间。蚊子感染后，余生均可传播病毒。\n蚊子会通过吸食含登革热病毒的人类血液而感染。被叮咬者可能已经出现登革热感染症状，也可能是尚未出现症状（出现症状前），还可能未出现任何疾病体征（无症状）。从人到蚊子的传播可能发生在某人出现疾病症状之前2天，也可能发生在退烧后2天。蚊子感染的风险与患者的高病毒血症和高热呈正相关；相反，登革热病毒特异性抗体水平高与蚊子感染风险降低相关。大多数人的病毒血症持续4-5天，但最长可持续12天。登革热病毒在人与人之间的主要传播方式是通过蚊媒。然而，有证据表明存在母婴传播的可能性（从怀孕的母亲传染给她的婴儿）。同时，垂直传播率似乎很低，但垂直传播风险似乎与孕期感染登革热的时间有关。如果母亲确实在孕期感染了登革热，婴儿可能遭受早产、低出生体重和胎儿窘迫等问题。已有通过血液制品、器官捐献和输血方式传播的罕见病例记录。同样，病毒在蚊虫体内的经卵传播也有记录。以前感染过登革热病毒会增加个人患重症登革热的风险。城市化（尤其是无序城市化）通过多种社会和环境因素（人口密度、人员流动、获得可靠水源、储水做法等）助长了登革热传播。社区面临的登革热风险还取决于人们对登革热的了解、态度和做法，这是由于接触登革热与储水、植物养护和自我保护以防蚊虫叮咬等行为密切相关。让社区参与常规的病媒监测和控制活动，可大大增强社区的抵御能力。病媒可能会适应新的环境和气候。登革热病毒、宿主和环境之间的相互作用是动态的。因此，疾病风险可能会随着热带和亚热带地区的气候变化以及城市化和人口流动的增加而变化和转变。\n传播登革热的蚊子在白天很活跃。可通过以下方式保护自己免受蚊虫叮咬和降低患登革热的风险：穿尽可能多遮盖身体的衣服；白天睡觉时使用蚊帐，最好是使用喷有驱虫剂的蚊帐；使用纱窗；使用驱蚊剂（含避蚊胺、派卡瑞丁或IR3535）；以及使用蚊香和喷雾驱蚊器。可通过以下方法预防蚊虫滋生：通过环境管理及治理措施，防止蚊子进入产卵栖息地；妥善处置固体废物，移除存水的人造栖息地；为家庭储水容器盖上盖子，并每周清空和清洁；在室外储水容器施用适当杀虫剂。如果患登革热，请务必：注意休息；多喝水；使用对乙酰氨基酚（扑热息痛）处理疼痛；避免使用非类固醇抗炎药（如布洛芬和阿司匹林）；以及如发现有任何严重症状，请尽快联系医生。迄今为止，有一种疫苗（QDenga）已在一些国家获得批准和许可。但是，仅建议在高传播环境中用于6 至 16 岁年龄组的儿童。正在对另外几种疫苗进行评估。\n以上这是一篇世界卫生组织的文章，我想知道其中提到的全球各个国家分别有多少病例，以及传播渠道、预防手段是怎么样的，以表格形式输出吧。涉及不同纬度的内容，最多给我输出2个表格",

      "problem_en": "Dengue fever (\"bone-breaking fever\") is a viral infection transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. It is more common in tropical and subtropical climates. Most dengue infections are asymptomatic. For symptomatic infections, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body pains, nausea, and rash. Most patients recover within 1–2 weeks. Some people develop severe dengue, requiring hospitalization. In severe cases, dengue can be fatal. The risk of dengue can be reduced by avoiding mosquito bites, especially during the daytime. There is currently no dengue-specific therapy; analgesics may be used for management.\n\nIn recent decades, dengue incidence worldwide has risen sharply, with reported cases to the World Health Organization increasing from 505,430 cases in 2000 to 5.2 million cases in 2019. The vast majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild and self-limiting, so the actual number of dengue cases exceeds the number reported. Many cases are misdiagnosed as other febrile illnesses (1).\n\n2023 recorded the highest number of dengue cases, affecting more than 80 countries across all WHO regions. Since early 2023, dengue has continued to spread, with case numbers rising unexpectedly to more than 6.5 million, a historic high, and more than 7,300 dengue-related deaths were reported.\n\nSeveral factors associated with increased risk of dengue epidemics include: changing distribution of vectors (primarily Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus), especially in countries that previously had no dengue; the consequences of the 2023 El Niño phenomenon and climate change leading to higher temperatures, more rainfall, and higher humidity; vulnerable health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic; political and financial instability and large-scale population movements in countries facing complex humanitarian crises.\n\nA modelling study estimated that 390 million dengue virus infections occur annually, of which 96 million are symptomatic (2). Another study estimating global dengue burden indicated that 3.9 billion people are at risk of dengue virus infection (3).\n\nThe disease is currently endemic in more than 100 countries across the WHO regions of Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific. The Americas, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific bear the heaviest burden, with Asia accounting for about 70% of the global disease burden. Dengue is spreading to new areas in Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, and South America. 2023 was the year with the most reported dengue cases. The WHO Americas region reported 4.5 million cases, with 2,300 deaths. Asia reported large numbers: Bangladesh (321,000 cases), Malaysia (111,400 cases), Thailand (150,000 cases), and Vietnam (369,000 cases).\n\nDengue virus is transmitted to humans by infected female mosquitoes (primarily Aedes aegypti). Other species of Aedes mosquitoes can be vectors but generally have lesser impact. However, in 2023 Europe saw a surge in locally transmitted dengue caused by Aedes albopictus.\n\nAfter a bite, the virus replicates in the mosquito’s midgut and then disseminates to secondary tissues including the salivary glands. The extrinsic incubation period—the time from feeding on an infected host to the mosquito’s ability to transmit to a new host—is roughly 8–12 days when ambient temperature is between 25–28°C. The extrinsic incubation period is influenced not only by ambient temperature; several other factors, such as daily temperature fluctuations, viral genotype, and initial viral dose, can also alter the time required for a mosquito to transmit the virus. Once infected, the mosquito can transmit the virus for life.\n\nMosquitoes become infected by feeding on human blood containing dengue virus. The bitten individuals may already have dengue symptoms, may be pre-symptomatic, or may be asymptomatic. Human-to-mosquito transmission can occur 2 days before symptom onset or 2 days after fever subsides. The risk of mosquito infection is positively correlated with high viremia and high fever; conversely, higher dengue virus–specific antibody levels are associated with a lower risk of mosquito infection. In most people, viremia lasts 4–5 days, but can last up to 12 days. The main mode of dengue virus transmission between humans is via mosquitoes. There is evidence of possible mother-to-child transmission (vertical transmission). The vertical transmission rate appears low, but risk seems related to the timing of infection during pregnancy. If a mother is infected with dengue during pregnancy, the infant may suffer preterm birth, low birth weight, and fetal distress. There have been rare cases transmitted through blood products, organ donation, and transfusion. Likewise, transovarial transmission of the virus within mosquitoes has been documented. Prior infection with dengue virus increases the risk of developing severe dengue in an individual. Urbanization (especially unplanned urbanization) fuels dengue transmission through various social and environmental factors (population density, mobility, access to reliable water, and water storage practices). The risk of dengue in a community also depends on knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding dengue, since exposure to dengue is closely related to water storage, plant care, and self-protection to prevent mosquito bites. Engaging communities in routine vector surveillance and control activities can greatly enhance community resilience. Vectors may adapt to new environments and climates. The interactions among dengue virus, host, and environment are dynamic. Therefore, disease risk may change with climate change in tropical and subtropical regions and with increasing urbanization and population movement.\n\nMosquitoes that transmit dengue are most active during the day. Ways to protect yourself from mosquito bites and reduce risk of dengue include: wear clothing that covers as much skin as possible; sleep under a bed net treated with insecticide during the day; use window screens; use repellents containing DEET, Picaridin, or IR3535; and use mosquito coils and spray devices. Ways to prevent mosquito breeding include: environmental management and control measures to prevent mosquitoes from entering breeding sites; proper disposal of solid waste; remove standing water from artificial containers; cover household water storage containers and weekly empty and clean them; apply appropriate insecticides to outdoor water storage containers. If you have dengue, be sure to: rest; drink plenty of fluids; use acetaminophen (paracetamol) for pain; avoid using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen and aspirin); and if any severe symptoms are observed, contact a physician promptly. To date, one vaccine (QDenga) has been approved and licensed in some countries. However, it is only recommended for children aged 6 to 16 years in high-transmission settings. Several other vaccines are being evaluated.",

My breasts have been very painful recently, they are hard, and it’s getting worse; at night the pain keeps me from sleeping; the breasts feel hot and swollen, touching them hurts. What should I do about breast hyperplasia?|General breast hyperplasia is usually caused by endocrine imbalance in the body, related to ongoing stress, diet, and rest. You can use symptomatic medications to manage breast hyperplasia, then maintain a regular schedule for sleep and meals, always keep a calm mindset, and avoid spicy or irritating foods. Patients should develop regular routines, persist with treatment, and eat a light diet with more aerobic exercise; this can boost immune function and reduce the risk of disease.|\n|What is the best way to manage breast hyperplasia?|I am 26, female. I experience some breast pain during menstruation, with mild signs of lobular hyperplasia, but I have not known that I have breast hyperplasia. What should I do?|Breast hyperplasia. Treatment may include taking Rupixiao (乳痞消) and symptomatic medications, etc. Also follow these points: 1) Regular routines; avoid staying up late or working overtime. 2) Always maintain a cheerful mood. 3) Avoid cold water during menstruation. 4) Regular and harmonious sexual life. 5) Breast health massage. 6) Timely reexaminations. During treatment, the patient should have a regulated diet, regular routines, actively participate in physical exercise, regulate mental and physical health, and maintain personal hygiene. Avoid infections due to reduced resistance.|\n|What to do about bilateral breast hyperplasia?|I am 27, female. My breasts have been very painful recently, hard and increasingly severe, at night the pain keeps me from sleeping; the breasts feel hot and swollen, touching them hurts. What should I do about bilateral breast hyperplasia?|Breast hyperplasia is a common phenomenon with a high incidence; it does not belong to a disease or a tumor, but is a benign reflection of normal fibrous changes in breast tissue. Drug treatment aims to reduce hyperplasia by adjusting endocrine disorders, but in daily life it is very important to avoid factors that are detrimental or aggravating to breast hyperplasia. Otherwise, relying solely on drugs is unlikely to suppress fibrosis. Take note of the following: 1) Maintain a good mindset: be less irritable, keep emotions stable; being lively and cheerful is conducive to early recovery of fibrosis. 2) Change dietary and lifestyle habits: eat less fried foods, high-calorie, high-fat, and spicy irritants. Eat more vegetables and fruits, and whole grains.|\n|What foods can relieve breast hyperplasia?|I am 25, female. During menstruation I experience some chest pain, with mild signs of lobular hyperplasia, but I don’t know if I have breast hyperplasia. What foods can relieve breast hyperplasia?|Generally breast hyperplasia is caused by endocrine imbalance, related to stress, diet, and rest. You can use symptomatic medications to nurture breast hyperplasia, then maintain regular routines and diet, always keep a calm mindset, avoid spicy or irritating foods. In daily life, patients should moderately supplement nutrients, do more aerobic exercise to strengthen the body, and maintain a cheerful mood to enhance physical fitness and speed up recovery.|\n|How can breast hyperplasia be treated well?|I am 25, female. My breasts recently hurt a lot, they are hard and increasingly painful; at night the pain keeps me from sleeping; the breasts feel hot and swollen; touching hurts. How should breast hyperplasia be treated effectively?|Limit spicy foods, avoid smoking and alcohol; pay attention to emotional regulation. Fibrosis is common and premenstrual breast stabbing pain can indicate fibrosis. You can take many drugs that promote blood circulation and dispel stasis, such as Ru增宁 (Ruzengning) and other traditional Chinese medicine preparations, but the course is long and effects vary by person. Daily, maintain regular routines, keep warm, eat light and soft foods, ensure good ventilation and drink plenty of hot water to prevent recurrence.|\n|What should I watch for with acute suppurative mastitis?|I am 45 this year, constantly feeling breast pain, I’m worried. What should I watch for with acute suppurative mastitis?|It is best to go to the hospital for a careful check to determine whether an abscess is present. When there is no purulent fluid, it is best to use a breast pump to thoroughly express milk or perform manual milk expression. If an abscess is present, promptly incision and drainage; stop breastfeeding, but the milk must be completely drained with a pump. Eat light yet very nutritious foods. Patients should maintain a positive mindset toward the disease; with such attitude, immunity and fighting spirit improve, and I believe this will help drive the illness away.|\n|What should I do about acute suppurative mastitis?|I am 49 this year, breast pain; I’m worried. What should I do?|Acute suppurative mastitis can be treated conservatively with anti-inflammatory drugs or hormones, but it’s best to go to a hospital to see a physician who will diagnose and treat based on your specific symptoms. If acute mastitis is severe, surgery may be needed. During lactation, ensure milk is fully expressed to keep it flowing.|\n|What should I watch after acute suppurative mastitis surgery?|I am 48 this year, always feel breast pain; I’m worried. What should I watch after acute suppurative mastitis surgery?|Postoperative patients should rest more and avoid vigorous exercise. Diet should be light; avoid spicy and irritating foods; do not tug or pull at the breast. Gentle breast massage is okay. Eat more fruits and fresh vegetables rich in vitamins; avoid triggering foods such as shrimp and certain fish. Maintain a positive mindset to boost immunity and fighting spirit; this can help drive the disease away.|\n|What should I be careful about with acute suppurative mastitis?|I am 40 this year, nursing, always feel breast pain; I’m worried. What should I be careful about with acute suppurative mastitis?|Because acute suppurative mastitis is commonly seen in breastfeeding mothers, if you are lactating you must keep milk flow unobstructed. Since the main treatment is incision and drainage, after surgery spicy and irritating foods are thought to aid wound scarring. Also avoid breast moisture to prevent infection. Additionally, in daily life, patients should balance nutrition, do more aerobic exercise to strengthen the body, and maintain a positive outlook to enhance fitness; good habits can help prevent disease.|\n|Can I become pregnant after acute suppurative mastitis surgery?|I am 40 this year, breast pain; I’m worried. Can I become pregnant after acute suppurative mastitis surgery?|Yes, you can. The best time for delivery and the best time for intercourse is around 5-7 pm; both the quantity and quality of sperm vary throughout the day, and peak in the late afternoon—coincidentally when women are most likely to give birth. Also, in daily life, you should balance nutrition, do aerobic exercise to stay fit, and maintain a positive mood to strengthen your body and prevent disease.|\n|What are the early signs of breast cancer?|I am 27, female. I’ve had breast pain for several days, foods I eat gradually increased; I found a lump in the breast, went to the hospital for a thorough check, diagnosed with breast cancer. What are the early signs of breast cancer?|Most breast cancer patients experience breast pain; the pain is typically sharp, dull, or aching. The nipple may show discharge that is colorless, milky white, pale yellow, or bloody; some may have purulent discharge. The skin around the breast may appear orange-peel (peau d’orange). There may be a lump inside the breast. During treatment, maintain a diet with discipline, regular routines, participate in physical exercise, regulate mental health, and maintain hygiene. Avoid infections due to weakened resistance.|\n|Can mid-stage breast cancer choose targeted therapy?|I am 27, female. I have breast pain for some days, foods gradually increased, found a lump, diagnosed with breast cancer. Can mid-stage breast cancer choose targeted therapy?|In mid-stage breast cancer, patients who cannot undergo surgery can benefit from targeted therapies to help control progression, but there are side effects and potential resistance; the course can be complemented with traditional Chinese medicine for adjustment. Eat more vitamin-rich fresh vegetables and fruits; such foods help strengthen immunity. In daily life, patients should balance nutrition, do more aerobic exercise, and maintain a positive mood to boost physical resilience and speed up recovery.|\nConsolidate these breast-related questions and answer the following:\n1) What is the most frequently asked category of questions?\n2) What is the age distribution of patients?",

Is my thyroid nodule getting bigger?\n\nDoctor: Hello, difficulty swallowing can indeed be related to thyroid nodules, but it isn’t necessarily caused by the nodules enlarging. If a thyroid nodule grows relatively large, or is in a position that compresses surrounding tissues such as the esophagus, it can cause dysphagia. However, there are many other reasons that can cause swallowing difficulties as well. May I ask whether you have had an ultrasound to see exactly how large the nodules are?\n\nPatient: The thyroid lobes on both sides are roughly symmetrical, the capsule is intact, the shape and size are normal, the echo is somewhat uneven. Both lobes have multiple cystic nodules; the larger one on the right is located in the lower portion, about 6×3 mm, the left lower one is about 5 mm, with punctate echogenic foci inside. CDFI shows thyroid blood flow signal grade 1. There are no abnormal lymph nodes around the thyroid or adjacent to the trachea. This is my ultrasound report.

      "problem_en": "《Self-Heating Multistage Microneedle Patch for Topical Therapy of Skin Cancer》\n\nRecently, a team led by Distinguished Professor Huang Peng of the School of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University, published a research paper in the world-class journal Advanced Materials (impact factor 29.4, CAS Zone 1, TOP journal) titled 《Self-Heating Multistage Microneedle Patch for Topical Therapy of Skin Cancer》. All work was completed at Shenzhen University; Associate Researcher Shao Jundong (now Professor at Guangzhou Medical University) and graduate student Li Xingxing are co-first authors; Professor Huang Peng is the corresponding author; Shenzhen University is the sole institution and the sole corresponding institution; the biomedical engineering discipline to which this team belongs is Guangdong Province’s key discipline.\n\nSkin cancer is one of the most common tumors, with incidence rising year by year, seriously threatening human life and health. Microneedle drug delivery technology, recognized by Global Science as one of the top ten technologies likely to change the world in 2020, has demonstrated unique advantages in the treatment of skin cancer. The research team developed a multilevel-structured microneedle drug delivery system, including: (1) a degradable needle tip for sustained drug release; (2) a soluble microneedle base for rapid drug release; (3) a backing layer for storing the self-heating material. The microneedle base is composed of a biocompatible medical polymer hyaluronic acid (HA), which rapidly dissolves during treatment to release the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for effective skin cancer treatment. The needle tips are made of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with appropriate biodegradability; as the base dissolves during treatment, the tips detach and linger at the lesion site to enable the sustained release of the antitumor drug thymoquinone (TQ), achieving long-term suppression of skin cancer recurrence. The backing layer is filled with self-heating material, based on the exothermic oxidation reaction of micron-scale iron powder, giving the microneedle delivery system efficient self-heating performance. Systematic in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated its excellent programmable drug release performance, good efficacy in treating skin cancer, and the ability to long-term suppress tumor recurrence. The self-heating effect not only provides a thermotherapy effect for skin cancer, but more importantly, shows excellent heat-assisted drug release, with substantial improvements in drug delivery rate, penetration depth, and dosage. This multilevel self-heating microneedle drug-loaded patch has enormous clinical application potential, particularly for skin cancer treatment.\n\nThis work was supported by the National Key R&D Program, the National Natural Science Foundation, the Guangdong Natural Science Foundation, the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission, and the Shenzhen Medical Research Program, among others.",

      "problem": "皮肤癌是全球典型的高发癌症之一，因其发病率高，病变扩散速度快，严重威胁到人类的生命健康。据世界卫生组织的统计，全世界每年约有300万例非黑色素瘤皮肤癌和13.2万例黑色素瘤皮肤癌，死亡率高达1.62%[1]。研究表明，早期发现的黑色素瘤的患者，五年相对存活率为98%[2]。其中，对于良性黑色素瘤患者，及早发现并切除就能够防止其恶化[3]。但对于晚期恶性的黑色素瘤，患者的5年生存率仅为15%。因此，皮肤癌变的早期筛查、诊断对于延缓病情发展、降低病人的死亡风险、争取更多的治疗时间至关重要。\n当前，针对皮肤癌变的诊断，主要是以皮肤镜检查并结合医生的知识经验为主。这不仅需要医生具有丰富的知识储备及阅片经验，还需要投入大量的时间和精力。此外，由于病情诊断依赖于医生的主观判断，皮肤镜图像中的毛发、血管、以及油性表面等微小的物质也会对医生的诊断结果带来一定的干扰，严重情况下可能出现误诊或漏诊的情况，延误病情的治疗。\n为了减轻医生的工作量，提高皮肤病诊断的准确率，研究人员提出了各种计算机智能辅助诊断系统，来实现皮肤图像中病灶区域的高效分割。早期，以传统的分割方法为主，如基于阈值的图像分割方法、基于边缘的分割方法、基于区域的分割方法等。虽然这些方法相较于医生主观判断可以取得较好的表现，但这类方法需要医生的介入来达到提取病灶区域的目的，且自我学习能力较差、鲁棒性能较弱，因此其性能方面具有很大的提升空间。\n随着GPU(Graphics Processing Unit）的发展，深度学习受到越来越多人的青睐，各种高效的分割网络模型相继被提出，如U型网络、图像语义分割深度网络等[4,5]。相较于传统的分割方法，它能够提取到更高维度的特征以及更详细的局部信息，在提高皮肤图像分割准确率的同时，也提高了医生的工作效率。\n近年来，研究人员提出了各种模型及算法来实现皮肤病灶的分割，并且取得了较好的成果，但是关于这一问题的总结性中文文献极少。为了弥补这一空缺，本文综合回顾了皮肤病灶图像分割的研究现状。具体来说，本文首先介绍了常见的皮肤病灶图像数据集，然后归纳总结了最近几年用于皮肤病灶分割的传统方法以及深度学习方法，包括但不限于其模型结构、优缺点等，最后分析了当前方法存在的问题，以及对未来研究趋势的展望。\n给这段文本取一个学术文章标题，要求信息完整、简洁明了、客观准确",

      "problem": "帮我给这篇文章取3个标题，每个标题12字，并且是XXXXXX，XXXXXX这种格式。\n我们口腔医生在数十年如一日的工作中，深刻认识到老年口腔疾病不仅仅影响他们的日常生活质量，其复杂性还与全身性疾病相互交织，给治疗和护理带来了巨大挑战。例如，老年癌症病人放化疗期间伴随牙齿松动和牙齿疼痛，该如何处理？老年糖尿病病人因为血糖高而口腔牙周炎加重，同时牙周炎疾病导致老人不能很好咀嚼，又反过来进一步加重糖尿病，该怎么办？\n因此，深入探讨老年口腔健康管理与全身疾病的关系，具有重大的现实指导意义。\n随着年龄增加，老年人口腔解剖和生理特点会发生增龄性变化，比如口腔干燥、牙龈萎缩、牙根外露、牙齿敏感，这些变化增加了龋坏风险。同时，随着老年人各项身体机能下降，他们维护口腔健康的难度也在增加。\n我们主要讨论老年口腔疾病与全身疾病的相互作用，揭示口腔疾病如何通过血液循环、免疫系统等途径影响全身健康，以及全身性疾病如何反过来加重口腔疾病的严重程度。\n一些研究表明，口腔疾病可能引发或加重多种全身疾病，同样地，某些全身疾病也会在口腔有所表现。例如，牙周炎与心血管疾病之间存在双向关系。究其原因，一方面，牙周炎患者体内的炎症因子水平升高，可能导致心血管问题；另一方面，心血管疾病患者由于血液循环和免疫功能的改变，也更容易患上牙周炎。糖尿病与口腔疾病也存在交互关系。\n糖尿病增加口腔感染的风险和严重程度，糖尿病患者也更容易出现牙周炎、根尖周炎、智齿冠周炎等口腔问题，甚至导致全身感染，引发败血症等严重并发症；而严重的口腔感染也会影响血糖控制，加重糖尿病病情。\n口腔疾病还与呼吸系统疾病、消化系统疾病以及类风湿关节炎等疾病存在一定关联。呼吸系统疾病方面，口腔卫生不良可能导致细菌吸入下呼吸道，引发肺炎等感染性疾病。特别是对于老年人和免疫力低下的人群，这种风险更为显著。消化系统疾病方面，口腔疾病也脱不了干系。例如，幽门螺杆菌不仅可在胃中定植，也可能存在于口腔中，与慢性胃炎、消化性溃疡等疾病发生和复发有关。自身免疫性疾病如系统性红斑狼疮，也可能累及口腔黏膜，导致黏膜溃疡、红斑等症状。在癌症方面，一些研究提示口腔癌与某些全身系统性因素，如遗传易感性、免疫功能障碍等存在关联。此外，精神心理疾病如抑郁症、焦虑症等与口腔疾病也相互影响。精神心理问题可能导致口腔卫生习惯变差，增加口腔疾病的发生风险；而口腔疾病带来的疼痛和不适，又可能加重患者的精神心理负担。\n目前，对于口腔健康与老年痴呆症的关联，科学家正在进行深入研究，主要集中在探索口腔炎症、牙齿缺失等因素是否通过影响营养摄入、神经炎症等途径加速老年痴呆症进展。而患有老年痴呆的老年朋友们口腔护理的难度急剧增加，他们中的一些人不仅自理能力差，甚至在家人、朋友以及护工对其进行牙齿护理时，配合程度也更低。\n口腔疾病与自身免疫性疾病如类风湿关节炎等之间共同的免疫通路和致病机制，受到研究者的高度关注。口腔疾病引发的免疫反应波及全身，全身免疫系统对口腔疾病又有一定的调控，这些问题都值得深入探讨。\n当前最严重的莫过于癌症患者的口腔健康问题，包括口腔癌与其他部位癌症的潜在联系以及口腔微生物在癌症发生发展中的作用等问题。口腔颌面部癌症患者，在患癌性疼痛的同时会发生牙齿疼痛。特别是在放化疗期间，癌症患者的口腔问题更需要引起关注和重视。\n另外，营养与生活方式的作用也不容忽视。不良的饮食习惯、吸烟、酗酒等生活方式因素，既可能导致口腔疾病，也可能是全身疾病的诱因。\n总之，口腔健康与全身健康息息相关，维护口腔健康对于预防和控制全身疾病具有重要意义。未来，随着多学科交叉研究的深入和新技术的应用，科学家有望进一步揭示口腔疾病与全身疾病相互作用的复杂机制，为疾病预防、诊断和治疗提供更精准的策略。\n希望大家能够深刻认识到老年口腔健康管理的重要性及其与全身健康的紧密联系。我们口腔医生也将努力引导大家建立正确的老年人口腔健康观念，宣传正确刷牙、使用牙线、牙缝隙刷、洁牙等口腔健康科普知识，让大家掌握科学的口腔保健方法，从而有效预防和治疗老年口腔疾病，提高老年人生活质量。\n对于同时患有或者伴随全身疾病的老年朋友，如果遇到牙齿疼痛、口腔黏膜疾病、风湿免疫疾病等等情况，需要及时就诊。经过医生的专业评估后，给予科学的、规范的个性化治疗。\n牙好、胃口好，吃嘛嘛香，身体才能更加好！让我们携手共进，为老年人的口腔健康贡献自己的力量。",

      "problem_en": "Please propose three titles for this article, each title consisting of 12 characters, in the format XXXXXX, XXXXXX.\n\nAs dental clinicians who have worked with unwavering dedication for decades, we have come to deeply understand that elderly oral diseases not only affect their daily quality of life, but their complexity also intertwines with systemic diseases, posing great challenges to treatment and care.\n\nFor example, how should we manage tooth mobility and toothache that accompany chemotherapy and radiotherapy in elderly cancer patients?\n\nIn elderly diabetics, high blood glucose worsens periodontal disease, while periodontitis makes chewing difficult, which in turn worsens diabetes—what should be done?\n\nTherefore, a thorough exploration of the relationship between elderly oral health management and systemic diseases has significant practical guiding value.\n\nWith increasing age, aging-related changes in the oral anatomy and physiology occur in older adults, such as xerostomia, gingival recession, root exposure, and tooth sensitivity, all of which increase the risk of caries. At the same time, as various bodily functions decline in older adults, maintaining oral health becomes more challenging.\n\nWe mainly discuss the interactions between elderly oral diseases and systemic diseases, revealing how oral diseases can influence overall health through pathways such as the circulatory system and immune system, and how systemic diseases can, in turn, worsen the severity of oral diseases.\n\nSome studies indicate that oral diseases may trigger or worsen a variety of systemic diseases, and likewise, certain systemic diseases can manifest in the oral cavity. For example, there is a bidirectional relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease. The reasons are that, on one hand, inflammatory mediator levels are elevated in patients with periodontitis, which may contribute to cardiovascular problems; on the other hand, patients with cardiovascular disease have changes in circulation and immune function, making them more susceptible to periodontitis. Diabetes and oral diseases also have an interactive relationship.\n\nDiabetes increases the risk and severity of oral infections; diabetic patients are more prone to periodontal disease, apical periodontitis, pericoronitis, and other oral problems, even leading to systemic infections and serious complications such as sepsis; whereas severe oral infections can affect glycemic control and worsen diabetes.\n\nOral diseases are also associated with respiratory diseases, digestive system diseases, and conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. In respiratory diseases, poor oral hygiene may lead to aspiration of bacteria into the lower respiratory tract, causing pneumonia and other infectious diseases. This risk is particularly pronounced in older adults and immunocompromised individuals.\n\nIn terms of the digestive system, oral diseases are also involved. For example, Helicobacter pylori can colonize not only in the stomach but may also be present in the oral cavity, related to the occurrence and recurrence of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers.\n\nAutoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus can also involve the oral mucosa, causing mucosal ulcers, erythema, and other symptoms.\n\nIn cancer, some studies suggest associations between oral cancer and certain systemic factors, such as genetic susceptibility and immune dysfunction.\n\nAdditionally, mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety interact with oral diseases. Psychological problems may lead to poorer oral hygiene, increasing the risk of oral disease; conversely, pain and discomfort from oral diseases can worsen patients' mental health burden.\n\nCurrently, scientists are investigating the association between oral health and Alzheimer's disease in the elderly, focusing mainly on whether factors such as oral inflammation and tooth loss can accelerate the progression of Alzheimer's disease through pathways such as nutritional intake and neuroinflammation. Elderly individuals with Alzheimer's disease experience markedly increased difficulty in oral care; some have poor self-care abilities, and even when family, friends, and caregivers provide dental care, cooperation is often limited.\n\nShared immune pathways and pathogenic mechanisms between oral diseases and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis have attracted considerable attention from researchers. The immune responses triggered by oral diseases can affect the whole body, and the systemic immune system also exerts regulatory effects on oral diseases; these issues warrant further exploration.\n\nThe most pressing current concern is the oral health problems of cancer patients, including potential links between oral cancer and cancers in other sites, and the role of oral microbiota in cancer development and progression. Patients with oral and maxillofacial cancers may experience dental pain in addition to cancer-related pain, especially during radiochemotherapy, when the oral problems of cancer patients require heightened attention.\n\nIn addition, nutrition and lifestyle factors cannot be ignored. Unhealthy eating habits, smoking, and excessive drinking, among other lifestyle factors, may cause oral diseases and may also be triggers for systemic diseases.\n\nIn short, oral health is closely related to overall health, and maintaining oral health is important for preventing and controlling systemic diseases. In the future, with deeper multidisciplinary collaboration and the application of new technologies, scientists are expected to further reveal the complex mechanisms underlying the interaction between oral and systemic diseases, providing more precise strategies for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\nWe hope everyone can recognize the importance of elderly oral health management and its close connection with overall health. We dental clinicians will also strive to guide the public to form correct concepts of elderly oral health, promote proper brushing, flossing, interdental brushes, professional cleaning, and other oral health education, enabling people to master evidence-based oral care methods to effectively prevent and treat elderly oral diseases and improve the quality of life for older adults.\n\nFor elderly individuals who have concomitant systemic diseases, if they experience toothache, oral mucosal disease, rheumatic-immune diseases, etc., they should seek timely medical attention. After professional evaluation by a physician, they should receive scientifically-based, standardized, personalized treatment.\n\nHealthy teeth, good appetite, and good health! Let us join hands to contribute to the oral health of older adults.",

      "problem": "您得过甲沟炎吗？能了解每走一步脚趾头都钻心的疼痛那种感觉吗？每次脱下鞋来，大脚趾头都是脓血的分泌物，有一股异味，自己都觉得难闻，而且感觉怎么用药、怎么修剪脚趾甲都不会有好转，脚趾头变得越来越大、越来越红、越来越肿，这种苦楚也只有得了甲沟炎的人才能了解吧！\n什么？您问俺为啥了解的这么清楚……因为谢医生在小学、初中以及高中阶段都深受这个毛病的折磨，可以说是资深的甲沟炎患者，今天咱们就来好好的聊聊这个毛病吧！\n01\n谢医生的个人经历……怎一个惨字了得！\n谢医生得甲沟炎的经历可是太久了，是小学五年级刚开始发作的那个时候，那时候体重就已经比较大了，刚开始有哪些症状，真的是记不清了，只记得从小学开始，双侧的大拇脚趾头就是又红又肿的，俺家老妈也不太在意这个事儿，也根本没拿它当个病看，所以谢医生本人也没太在乎。\n之后，它疼啊！每走一步都疼，玩儿起来就忘记了，一闲下来写作业就疼的厉害，所以就天天回家跟老妈赖叽！那咋办？俺家老妈就用了各种各样的土办法，用盐水泡，用糖水泡，听人家说用咸黄瓜包住脚趾头包它一阵儿就能好，结果俺的脚趾头上就套上了咸黄瓜……结果是一点也没好。\n后来就疼的越来越严重了，脚趾甲把脚趾头顶出了一个大洞，每天都流脓淌水的，一脱鞋就一股臭味，夏天还好，到了冬天那个酸爽就别提了！\n后来是怎么好的呢？上大学的时候跟同学们踢球，当时使劲踢了一脚，结果呢，脚趾甲把整个脚趾头顶出一个豁口出来，当时可以说是疼的痛彻心扉，将近一个月的时间不敢剪脚趾甲，结果脚趾甲顺着这个豁口顶了出来，脚趾甲不再往肉里顶了，慢慢的炎症也就消退了。\n之后仿佛醍醐灌顶了，另外一只脚也不再剪脚趾甲了，慢慢的自己顶出来一个豁口，双侧的甲沟炎也就这样治愈了。\n但是这个病程实在是太久了，期间遭的罪就别提了！\n现在回想其实真的是挺万幸的，没有因为各种乱糟糟的所谓处置，导致炎症进一步的扩散造成骨髓炎！\n02\n甲沟炎到底是个啥病？为啥那么多人容易得这个毛病呢？\n其实甲沟炎很好理解，就是在我们趾甲边上有一个沟，这个沟呢，在各种原因的刺激下，有可能造成局部的感染，造成患者局部的疼痛、肿胀等等各种症状。\n甲沟炎呢，可以分为嵌甲型，凹陷性或者是扁平型，嵌甲型是最常见的一种类型，就是趾（指）甲往我们脚趾（手指）头肉里头长。根据致病原因呢，也可以分为外伤性的甲沟炎和生长性的甲沟炎；根据感染的病原菌不同，又可以有不同的分型，在这里我们大家不要了解的那么详细，最常见的还是嵌甲型的甲沟炎，往往都是细菌感染，大家知道这一点就可以了。\n甲沟炎一般分为三个阶段，首先是急性的炎症期，患者明显的疼痛，慢慢的就会有脓肿的形成，这就是第2个阶段；反复的感染与组织修复又会造成肉芽肿的形成，这就是第3期也叫做肉芽肿期。\n那么导致甲沟炎有哪些原因呢？常见的，还是有以下几种：\n●修剪趾甲剪得太短，修剪趾甲方式错误。\n●穿不适合的鞋子，尤其是鞋太窄，长时间的挤压脚趾，很容易导致嵌甲的形成。\n●外伤也是导致出现脚趾甲沟炎比较常见的一个原因，尤其是一些喜爱运动的人群。训练也是一个因素，部队官兵患甲沟炎的情况也是比较常见的。\n●在体重比较大的人群当中，患甲沟炎的情况比较多。\n03\n常见的处理甲沟炎的方法有哪些呢？咱们聊一聊！\n当谢医生成为了骨科医生，才慢慢的了解到甲沟炎这个常见的疾病，有那么多的处理办法，回想起来遭的那些罪，真的有点傻，当时对于疾病也太轻视了，常见的处理甲沟炎的办法，谢医生给大家详细的介绍一下。\n●首先，重中之重，正确的修剪趾甲很重要。\n大家肯定觉得既然是甲沟炎，趾甲往肉里长，那我们就要尽量的把趾甲修的越小越好，或者是把脚趾甲修剪的像手指一样，修成一个圆弧形，这样就会减少对于周边软组织的刺激，其实这个做法是错误的。\n正确的修剪办法是要让脚趾甲的边缘，要超过脚趾的肉，不要短于肉的边缘，这样才不给嵌甲造成机会，大家想一想，谢先生用暴力方法治愈甲沟炎的经历，其实就是这样一个修剪方式的改变。\n\n●外用药物治疗。\n如果您的甲沟炎症状比较轻，红肿相对来讲不是那么的严重，有少量的渗出，那么完全可以通过外用药物的办法来帮助自己控制症状，常见的碘伏消毒就是比较好的一个办法，每天反复涂抹几次，尽量在日常生活当中保持足部的暴露，保持干燥，就能获得较好的效果。\n在临床上最常见的造成甲沟炎的细菌感染是金黄色葡萄球菌，局部红肿明显，可伴有脓性的渗出物，有研究对7种甲沟炎常见的外用抗菌药物进行了对比分析，结果显示莫匹罗星软膏的抑菌效果最为显著。\n●一些简易的办法，您可以尝试下。\n您可以先用碘伏把感染的趾甲周边好好的消毒一下，之后用生理盐水清洗，再用小的棉花剪成一个小小的填塞物，放在趾甲的边缘，这样呢可以阻止趾甲的异常生长，减少对于周边软组织的刺激。\n还可以把输液管剪成一个小段，之后呢，从中间剖开，包住趾甲边缘，阻止异常的趾甲生长，但是这个方法很不舒服，个人觉得还是棉花条相对来讲比较简单易行。●手术疗法。\n以前对于严重的甲沟炎的治疗，我们往往采取拔甲术，患者挺遭罪的。\n现在呢，对于这种手术已经进行了改良，往往采取一些比较简单的办法，仅仅切除有问题一侧部分趾甲以及切除相对应的甲基和甲根，这样呢，患者在门诊就可以进行手术，创伤小、恢复快，而且不影响患者的行走。\n04\n总结\n这里谢医生必须要说，如果您甲沟炎感染明显，尽量要到医院让专业的医生看一看（千万别和谢医生小时候学），再决定自己应该怎么办，如果肿胀不是特别严重，可以到医院的皮肤科寻求医生的帮助，但如果感染的特别严重，肿胀畸形，而且有大量的肉芽肿形成这种情况，有可能需要手术治疗，那么您一定要寻求专业骨科医生的帮助。\n甲沟炎这个病不大，但是却挺折磨人，属于典型的癞蛤蟆上脚背，不咬人，膈应人的这么一种疾病，遇到了这种情况别急，谢先生的这篇文章相信对您会有一定的帮助，如果您还有其他的疑惑可以在下方留言，咱们大家共同探讨。\n另外相对于脚趾甲的甲沟炎，手指的甲沟炎相对比较少（多见于糖尿病人），就不在这里给大家一一赘述了。\n我是坚持用简单语言解释复杂疾病知识的谢新辉，码字不易，如果您赞同我的观点或者对您有所帮助，请您点个关注或点个赞吧，如果您或者是您的家人朋友也有甲沟炎这方面的困扰，先把这篇文章转发给需要的他们吧，谢谢了！\n\n根据以上文章取一个小红书标题，要带有emoji，能详细概括文章内容，标题风格要轻松欢快，不能太过专业。",

      "problem_en": "Have you ever had paronychia? Can you imagine the sensation of a stabbing pain with every step your toe takes? Every time you take off your shoes, the big toe is filled with purulent discharge and a foul odor, something you yourself find disgusting, and no matter how you treat it with medicine or how you trim your toenails, there’s no improvement—the toe becomes larger, redder, and more swollen. This kind of misery can only be understood by someone who has paronychia!\nWhat? You ask why I’m so sure about this... because Dr. Xie has suffered from this problem since elementary, middle, and high school—he is a veteran paronychia patient. Today we’ll have a proper chat about this condition!\n01\nDr. Xie’s personal experience… how can one word describe it? Miserable!\nDr. Xie’s paronychia experience goes back a long way; it started in the fifth grade. At that time his weight was already relatively high, and the exact initial symptoms are hard to recall; I only remember that from elementary school onward, both big toes were red and swollen. My mother didn’t pay much attention to it and didn’t regard it as a disease, so Dr. Xie himself didn’t care much either.\nThen it hurt! Every step hurt; when he played, he would forget the pain, but when he settled down to do homework, the pain was severe, so he would go home every day and cling to his mother! So what to do? My mother tried all sorts of folk remedies—soaking in salt water, soaking in sugar water, and hearing that wrapping the toe with salted cucumber could heal it after a while, so my toe ended up wrapped in salted cucumber… but it didn’t help at all.\nThe pain grew worse, the nail began to push out a large hole in the toe, and there was purulent discharge every day. When you took off your shoes there was a foul odor; summer was tolerable, but winter was another story altogether!\nHow did it get better later? In college, I played soccer with classmates and kicked hard once, and the toenail punched through the entire toe, creating a gouge. The pain was excruciating; for almost a month I didn’t dare trim my nails, and the nail grew out along this gouge, no longer pressing into the flesh, and the inflammation gradually subsided.\nAfter that, it felt like a revelation; the other foot also stopped trimming nails, gradually forming its own gouge, and the paronychia on both sides was cured.\nBut the disease course was incredibly long, and the suffering cannot be overstated!\nLooking back, it’s fortunate that there wasn’t an outcome where the inflammation spread to osteomyelitis due to all sorts of chaotic so-called treatments!\n02\nWhat exactly is paronychia? Why do so many people easily develop this condition?\nParonychia is easy to understand: there is a groove along the edge of our nail; due to various stimuli, this groove can become locally infected, causing local pain, swelling, and other symptoms.\nParonychia can be categorized into ingrown type, concave or flat types; the ingrown type is the most common, where the nail grows into the flesh of the toe (or finger). Depending on cause, it can be traumatic paronychia or developmental/paronychia; depending on the infectious pathogen, there are different subtypes. Here we don’t need to go into too many details—the most common is the ingrown type, usually caused by bacterial infection. That’s enough to know.\nParonychia generally occurs in three stages: first, the acute inflammatory stage with obvious pain; gradually an abscess forms—that’s the second stage; repeated infections and tissue repair lead to granulation tissue formation, the third stage, also called the granulation stage.\nWhat are the causes of paronychia? Common causes include the following:\n● Trimming the nails too short or trimming them incorrectly.\n● Wearing ill-fitting shoes, especially very tight ones; prolonged squeezing of the toes easily leads to ingrown nails.\n● Trauma is also a common cause of paronychia, especially among people who love sports. Training is a factor as well; soldiers in the service also commonly suffer from paronychia.\n● Higher incidence among heavier individuals.\n03\nWhat are the common methods for treating paronychia? Let’s discuss!\nWhen Dr. Xie became an orthopedic surgeon, he gradually learned how common this disease is and how many treatment methods exist. Thinking back to those sufferings, it was foolish to underestimate the disease; here Dr. Xie will detail common treatments.\n● First and foremost, correct nail trimming is crucial.\nEveryone may think that since it’s paronychia and the nail grows into the flesh, we should trim the nail as short as possible, or trim it to resemble a finger with a curved arc, so as to reduce stimulation to the surrounding soft tissue. In fact, this approach is wrong.\nThe correct trimming method is to make the edge of the nail extend beyond the flesh of the toe; do not trim shorter than the edge of the flesh. This prevents ingrown nails from forming. Think about Dr. Xie’s experience curing paronychia with a more aggressive trimming approach—this is basically a change in trimming method.\n● Topical medication treatment.\nIf your paronychia symptoms are relatively mild, with redness and swelling not too severe and minimal discharge, you can completely manage the symptoms with topical drugs. Povidone-iodine disinfection is a good approach; apply it repeatedly several times daily, and try to keep the feet exposed and dry in daily life to achieve better results.\nClinically, the most common bacteria causing paronychia is Staphylococcus aureus; local redness and swelling with purulent discharge are typical. A study comparing seven common topical antibacterial agents for paronychia found that mupirocin ointment had the strongest antimicrobial effect.\n● Some simple methods you can try.\nFirst, thoroughly disinfect around the infected nail with povidone-iodine, then rinse with saline, and cut small cotton strips into tiny packing material to place at the edge of the nail. This can prevent abnormal nail growth and reduce irritation to surrounding soft tissue.\nYou can also cut a small segment from an IV tubing, split it in the middle, wrap it around the nail edge to block abnormal nail growth; but this method is quite uncomfortable. Personally, cotton strips are simpler and easier to implement.\n● Surgical therapy.\nIn the past, severe paronychia was treated with nail avulsion, which was very painful for patients.\nNowadays this surgery has been refined; often a simpler approach is used: removing only the problematic side portion of the nail and removing the corresponding nail matrix and nail root. This allows outpatient surgery with minimal trauma, a quick recovery, and no impact on the patient’s ability to walk.\n04\nSummary\nHere Dr. Xie must say: if your paronychia infection is obvious, go to a hospital and have a professional doctor examine you (do not imitate the childhood methods described here), and decide what you should do. If the swelling is not very severe, you can seek help from dermatology in the hospital, but if the infection is particularly severe and there is swelling deformity and a large amount of granulation tissue, surgery may be required, so be sure to seek help from a professional orthopedic doctor.\nParonychia is not a big disease, but it is quite tormenting; it’s a typical “toad on the instep” that doesn’t bite but irritates people. If you encounter this, don’t panic. I believe this article will be of some help. If you have any other questions, you can leave a comment below and we can discuss together.\nAdditionally, compared with toenail paronychia, finger paronychia is relatively rarer (more common in diabetics), so I won’t go into detail here.\nI am Xie Xinhui, who aims to explain complex disease knowledge in simple language. Writing is not easy. If you agree with my views or find this helpful, please follow or like. If you or your family or friends also have paronychia, please share this article with those who need it.

      "problem_en": "Ischemic stroke is a cerebrovascular disease and a type of onset of stroke, caused by a sudden interruption of blood supply and oxygen to the brain, leading to weakness of one side of the body, the upper and lower limbs, or the entire body, presenting paralysis (hemiplegia). With the progression of population aging, ischemic stroke has become a common and frequently occurring clinical condition, seriously threatening people’s health. Conventional pharmacologic treatment for acute ischemic stroke can reduce brain edema, prevent the aggravation of ischemic brain injury, degrade fibrin and dissolve clots, promote growth of neural cell axons and functional reorganization, thereby controlling the disease course and restoring damaged brain function. Combined with rehabilitation treatment can maximize the functional recovery of hemiplegia patients and has become a key issue in modern clinical rehabilitation medicine in China.\n1 研究对象与方法\n1. Subjects and Methods\nThis study adopts a controlled trial design, on the basis of a systematic one-month standardized rehabilitation treatment for cerebral infarction, using the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment and the Modified Barthel Index to evaluate rehabilitation effects, in order to explore the influence of early rehabilitation on the functional recovery of patients with acute cerebral infarction-induced hemiplegia.\n1.1 研究对象\n1.1 Subjects\nForty-eight acute cerebral infarction patients admitted to the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, PLA General Hospital (309 Hospital), including 27 males and 21 females. Inclusion criteria: (1) conforms to the diagnostic criteria of the 1995 National Conference on Cerebrovascular Diseases [1], and CT or MRI-confirmed cerebral infarction; (2) first onset; (3) ADL score on admission between 40 and 60; (4) vital signs stable for more than 48 hours.\nUsing a selective grouping approach, selected patients were divided into Early-Rehabilitation Group, Non-Early-Rehabilitation Group, and Control Group. The Early-Rehabilitation Group underwent rehabilitation training within 14 days; the Non-Early-Rehabilitation Group underwent rehabilitation training from day 15 to day 60; the Control Group consisted of patients whose records showed only routine treatment and care without rehabilitation training. Other treatments were the same.\nThe gender, age, and rehabilitation time of the three groups are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences among groups in gender, age, or rehabilitation time.\n1.2 研究方法\n1.2 Methods\n1.2.1 治疗方法\n1.2.1 Treatment\nMotor function rehabilitation methods:\nThe American Heart Association outlines the major contents of stroke rehabilitation as: (1) diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of complications; (2) maximal independence training; (3) psychological coping and adaptation; (4) social readaptation to prevent secondary disability; (5) utilizing residual function to improve quality of life; (6) preventing recurrence of stroke and other vascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction.\nTreatment, aligned with the characteristics of central motor disorders, proceeds through a staged recovery process (flaccid phase → spastic phase → recovery phase) [3,4,5]. Specific operations follow the Brunnström stages [6], combining Brunnström technique, Rood technique, and Bobath technique.\nPsychological rehabilitation: analyze and understand the patient’s psychological activity, provide patient-centered and rational psychological counseling, and eliminate psychological barriers. Strengthen disease knowledge dissemination to ensure correct understanding of the disease and active cooperation with rehabilitation. Stimulate confidence in life, thereby benefiting recovery.\n1.2.2评定标准\n1.2.2 Evaluation criteria\nMotor function assessment used the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA); Activities of Daily Living (ADL) were assessed with the Modified Barthel Index (MBI).\n1.2.3 统计学分析\n1.2.3 Statistical analysis\nEvaluation data were processed with SPSS 13.0. Continuous data were described as mean ± standard deviation and analyzed with t-tests and ANOVA; categorical data were analyzed with chi-square tests; inter-group comparisons used F-tests and chi-square tests. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant, with high significance noted where applicable.\n2 结果\n2. Results\n2.1 运动功能评定(FMA)\nCompared with the Control Group, the Early-Rehabilitation Group showed no significant difference in baseline FMA, but after one month of rehabilitation, the Early-Rehabilitation Group’s recovery level was markedly higher than the Control Group (P<0.05). Additionally, the Early-Rehabilitation Group’s treatment effect was significantly better than that of the Non-Early-Rehabilitation Group.\n2.2 日常生活活动能力评定MBI\nCompared with the Control Group, the Early-Rehabilitation Group showed no significant difference in baseline MBI, but after one month of rehabilitation, the Early-Rehabilitation Group’s recovery level was markedly higher than the Control Group (P<0.05). Furthermore, the Early-Rehabilitation Group’s treatment effect was significantly better than that of the Non-Early-Rehabilitation Group.\n3 分析与讨论\n3. Analysis and Discussion\nIn China, it is generally believed [7,8,9] that rehabilitation within one month after onset constitutes early rehabilitation, though there is not yet a unified standard for the timing of early rehabilitation. Typically, patients should have a GCS score > 8, the lesion should show definite reversal, and vital signs should be stable (temperature, respiration, pulse, and blood pressure within normal ranges) for more than 24 hours (some set 48 hours) before rehabilitation training. Early rehabilitation for stroke patients begins relatively early (three to five days after onset), while for intracerebral hemorrhage patients it begins later (two to three weeks) [10].\nFrom Table 2, at enrollment the Early-Rehabilitation Group and Control Group showed no significant difference in scores; after one month, both groups improved, but this spontaneous improvement was limited and differed significantly from the rehabilitation group, with the rehabilitation group showing clearly superior treatment effects compared to the Control Group.\nFrom Table 3, baseline scores between the Early-Rehabilitation Group and Control Group showed no significant differences; after 30 days, the scores differed significantly, with the Early-Rehabilitation Group markedly superior to the Control Group. This may be related to rehabilitation accelerating the formation of new neural pathways, remodeling around the lesion or contralateral brain cells, and greatly promoting brain plasticity.\nFunctional reorganization after central nervous system injury is an important factor in functional recovery, but spontaneous cortical reorganization in the brain is limited. To enhance the degree of recovery, functional training is one of the most important factors. Timely rehabilitation centered on motor therapy facilitates the influx of sensory information from skin and joints and the efflux of motor commands from the brain, thereby promoting cortical reorganization and ultimately restoring motor function [11,12,13].\n4 结论\n4 Conclusion\nEarly rehabilitation is safe and feasible, and it yields clearer improvements in patients’ motor function and daily living activities than non-early rehabilitation or natural recovery, while preventing and reducing the occurrence of hemiplegia-related complications, minimizing disability, and aiding better social reintegration.\nFurther confirms that the effects of early rehabilitation are not due to early spontaneous recovery.\n给这篇学术论文取5个专业的大标题，给出打分，帮我选出一个分数最高的。字数不超过15字\nProvide five professional major headings for this scholarly article, assign scores, help me select the highest-scoring one.

      "problem_en": "**Early Rehabilitation Nursing Intervention in Acute Ischemic Stroke**\n\n1. Patient Population\nClinical Data: A total of 80 inpatients admitted between June 2013 and June 2014 who met the diagnostic criteria revised by the latest guidelines and were confirmed by cranial MRI as acute cerebral infarction, aged 40–70 years, onset within 24 hours, with limb motor impairment and muscle strength 0–IV in non-comatose patients. Exclusion criteria included hemorrhagic stroke, recurrent stroke, vertebrobasilar system stroke and TIA attacks, sensory aphasia and severe cognitive impairment, hepatic, renal or cardiac dysfunction, history of mental illness, and other systemic diseases. Among them, 53 were male and 28 were female; 23 had right‑sided infarction and 57 had left‑sided infarction; infarctions involved frontal, temporal, parietal and cortical regions in 52 cases and basal ganglia in 38 cases. On admission, onset time exceeded the 6‑hour window, making thrombolysis unsuitable. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in sex, age, disease severity, baseline medications, or rehabilitative therapy, indicating comparability.\n\n2. Intervention Protocols\nBoth groups received standard neurological treatment and nursing care. The observation group, on this basis, upon stabilization within 48 hours of admission, received a comprehensive nursing intervention plan formulated by nurses. Specific measures included:\nInpatient Environment Improvement\nAn optimal, quiet, clean inpatient environment is crucial for recovery. In the ward, patients should receive no less than 1 hour of light exposure daily, and ward cleanliness should be maintained to create a conducive rest environment with proper lighting. Regular sterilization of the ward should be performed; hygiene should be maintained at all times to support immune recovery during rehabilitation.\n\nClose Monitoring of Condition\nVital signs should be vigilantly monitored, with close observations of pupil changes. Report any abnormalities to the attending physician promptly. Monitor for vomiting and note the nature, color, and amount of vomitus. During emergency care, place the patient in a lateral position to prevent airway obstruction by vomitus, and use positional drainage to aid airway clearance if needed.\n\nPsychological Support\nSystematic, quantified psychological interventions should be provided early after onset across four aspects: information support, psychological counseling, increased social support, and the establishment of self-help groups [1]. Specifically: (1) 25 minutes of health education for each patient daily; (2) three weekly counseling sessions to help patients adjust to disease and other difficulties, regulating mental state; (3) communication with family and friends to ensure correct support, helping patients build confidence and actively participate in treatment; (4) regular group sessions for patients and families to learn about disease knowledge, discuss collectively, strengthen team awareness, and overcome the illness together.\n\nFunctional Rehabilitation Training\n1) Sensory function training: while seated, support the affected upper limb to bear weight to train both motor and sensory functions. Under the palm of the supporting hand, place materials with different textures. Extend the affected fingers flat on a table and move them in various directions to produce friction on the palm.\n2) Hand function recovery: train finger grasping and fine motor activities using various sized wooden pegs or pencils, holding them and flipping them up and down or front to back to enhance dexterity.\n3) Other functional restoration training: after the acute phase of cerebral infarction, softening lesions or thrombus compressing intracranial nerves may cause paralysis or hemiplegia. Rehabilitation should be performed with supervision, including daily hand and foot exercises. Depending on the individual, provide physical therapy or acupuncture as appropriate to improve limb function. Acupuncture points may include Baihui (DU20), Shangxing, Sishencong, Wanggu, Quchi, Shousanli, Neiwai Guan, Hegu, Zusanli, Sanyinjiao, and Yongquan.\n\n3. Outcome Assessments\nAssess neurological deficit scores and functional independence scores in patients.\nStatistical Methods\nAll data were entered into SPSS 13.0 for analysis. Continuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Differences between groups were compared using t-tests, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant.\n\n4. Results\nNeurological Deficit Scores: After comprehensive rehabilitation, the treatment scores before and after intervention for both groups are shown in Table 1. The differences in neurological deficit scores before and after treatment between groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05); post-treatment scores were better than pre-treatment, and the observation group showed greater improvement than the control group.\nFunctional Independence Scores: Table 2 shows the functional independence scores before and after treatment for both groups. The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05); post-treatment scores were better than pre-treatment, and the observation group showed greater improvement than the control group.\n\n5. Discussion\nThe study indicates that implementing early rehabilitation nursing interventions in patients with acute cerebral infarction significantly reduces neurological deficit scores and yields a greater reduction in the observation group. Functional independence scores also increased markedly, with the observation group showing a larger improvement than the control group. These results suggest that systematic early rehabilitation nursing for patients with acute ischemic stroke can effectively promote clinical improvement and outcomes.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Hou Caiye.

      "problem": "采用提问的形式，为下文拟定一个文章标题\n为积极适应老龄化社会发展，缓解“一人住院，全家奔波”的后顾之忧，今天，国家医保局出台护理类立项指南（试行）和优化调整护理价格政策通知，统一指导各省规范护理价格项目；同时新设“免陪照护服务”价格项目，满足群众多样化的护理服务需求。统一指导各省规范护理价格项目 将护理价格项目统一为三大类\n据了解，国家医保局将各省目前名称和内涵不一致的护理价格项目统一分类，包括分级护理、专科护理、专项护理三大类，整合为22项价格项目。其中，分级护理是根据对病人病情轻、重、缓、急及自理能力评估后，给予不同级别的基础护理服务，由重到轻分为特级、Ⅰ级、Ⅱ级、Ⅲ级护理。\n除了规范护理价格项目，国家医保局同时新设“免陪照护服务”价格项目。所谓“免陪照护服务”是指由医疗机构的专业医疗护理员，为住院患者提供24小时不间断的生活照护服务，不再依赖患者家属亲自陪护。总体上，医疗机构的医疗护理员岗位职责相对固定，专业性更强，既有利于照护患者，也能够减轻患者家属负担。\n目前，国家医保局明确现阶段“免陪照护服务”仅适用于特级、Ⅰ级护理患者，且暂不纳入医保。\n那么，“免陪照护服务”将如何收费呢？针对地方的探索经验，国家医保局对“免陪照护服务”价格项目实行政府指导价管理。2024年底前各省对接落实立项指南后，试点地区免陪照护服务收费将有据可依。虽然此次通知并未明确具体的服务价格，但此前的试点城市可以为我们提供参考。在浙江安吉，当地将无陪护病房护理费分三档按天收费：一对一服务160元、一对二服务120元、一对三服务100元。相比患者家属自己请护工，费用便宜了几十元。\n安吉县89岁的患者万荣华因为脑梗，不久前在医院进行康复治疗。由于子女在外地打工，医院为他办理了“无陪护”病房服务。\n加强对护理员的培训和教育 满足群众多样化的护理服务需求\n对于患者家属来说，护理员的服务是否到位，照顾是否专业是最为关心的问题之一。那么，该如何提升护理员的专业水平，满足群众多样化的护理服务需求呢？\n国家医保局表示，为保证服务质量，相关行业主管部门和医疗机构，应进一步加强对护理员的培训和教育工作。对此，各地也在积极探索。在河南的这家老年康复护理院，健康照护师刘驰正在给失能老人翻身、喂餐。经过专业培训的她，不仅照护病人细心，还精通各类医学基础知识。不仅要有专业的技能储备，对护理员的工作进行监督与考评也至关重要。在福建，护理员上岗后，他们的工作质量要接受患者家属、医院和公司的多重监管，每天、每周、每月进行打分。\n北京大学医学人文学院教授 王岳：要设定好相应的标准和培训，而且有相应的考核指标，由病人家属来考核护理人员。\n此外，为更好体现护理技术劳务价值，专家表示，将推动调价结果向护士薪酬水平传导，吸引并稳定更多人才从事护理工作。\n中国社会保障学会副研究员 张圣和：改为 （让）护理价格调整红利传导到一线护士队伍中去，从而提高护士职业的吸引力，也能让更多人才愿意从事护士工作。这样才能稳定并壮大医护人员队伍，从根本上去解决护理服务缺口问题。",

      "problem_en": "To actively adapt to the development of an aging society and alleviate the burden on families where “one person is hospitalized, the whole family is rushing around,” today the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) issued the Nursing Project Guidelines (Trial) and a notice on optimizing and adjusting nursing price policies, providing unified guidance for provinces to standardize nursing price items; at the same time, a new “unaccompanied care service” price item was introduced to meet the public’s diverse nursing service needs. Unified guidance for provinces to standardize nursing price items. The nursing price items are consolidated into three major categories.\n\nIt is understood that NHSA will standardize nursing price items whose names and meanings vary across provinces, including tiered nursing care, specialty nursing, and special nursing services, consolidating them into 22 price items. Among them, tiered nursing care is based on an assessment of the patient’s condition as mild, severe, non-urgent, and urgent, and the patient’s self-care ability, to provide different levels of basic nursing services. From most intensive to least intensive, it is divided into Special-grade care, Level I, Level II, and Level III nursing care.\n\nIn addition to standardizing nursing price items, NHSA also newly established the “unaccompanied care service” price item. The so-called “unaccompanied care service” refers to 24-hour continuous life-care services for hospitalized patients provided by the institution’s professional nursing aides, no longer relying on the patient’s family to accompany them personally. Overall, the positions of nursing aides in medical institutions are relatively fixed and more specialized, which is conducive to caring for patients and can also alleviate the burden on patients’ families.\n\nCurrently, NHSA clarifies that at this stage “unaccompanied care service” is only applicable to patients receiving Special-grade and Level I nursing care, and is not yet included in medical insurance.\n\nSo, how will “unaccompanied care service” be charged? Based on local exploratory experiences, NHSA implements government-guided price management for the “unaccompanied care service” price item. By the end of 2024, after provinces align with and implement the project guidelines, pilot areas’ charges for unaccompanied care services will have a basis to rely on. Although this notice does not specify exact service prices, previous pilot cities can provide references. In Anji, Zhejiang, the local unaccompanied ward care charges are divided into three daily tiers: one-to-one service 160 yuan, one-to-two service 120 yuan, one-to-three service 100 yuan. Compared with patients’ family members hiring caregivers themselves, the costs are tens of yuan cheaper.\n\nAnji County’s 89-year-old patient Wan Ronghua had a stroke and recently underwent rehabilitation treatment in the hospital. Because his children work away from home, the hospital arranged an unaccompanied ward service for him.\n\nStrengthening training and education for nursing aides to meet the public’s diverse nursing service needs\n\nFor patients’ families, whether the nursing aides’ services are satisfactory and whether the care is professional are among the most concerned questions. So how can we enhance the professional level of nursing aides to meet the public’s diverse nursing service needs?\n\nNHSA says that to ensure service quality, relevant industry authorities and medical institutions should further strengthen the training and education of nursing aides. Localities are actively exploring this as well. In Henan’s elderly rehabilitation nursing home, health care worker Liu Chi is turning bedridden elderly residents and feeding them. Trained professionally, she is not only careful in caregiving but also proficient in basic medical knowledge. Not only must there be professional skill reserves, but supervising and evaluating nursing aides’ work is crucial. In Fujian, after nursing aides start work, their performance must be subjected to multi-level supervision by patients’ families, the hospital, and the company, with daily, weekly, and monthly scoring.\n\nProfessor Wang Yue of the Peking University School of Medical Humanities: Standards and training must be properly established, with corresponding assessment indicators, evaluated by the patients’ families.\n\nMoreover, to better reflect the value of nursing technology services, experts say that pricing adjustments should be transmitted to nurses’ salary levels to attract and retain more talent in nursing work.\n\nZhang Shenghe, Associate Researcher at the Chinese Society of Social Security: Channel the benefits of nursing price adjustments to frontline nursing teams, thereby increasing the attractiveness of the nursing profession and enabling more people to choose nursing work. Only in this way can we stabilize and grow the medical and nursing workforce, fundamentally addressing the nursing service gap.",

      "problem_en": "Based on the following content, craft a news headline for this passage.\n\nAccording to the latest estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 10.3 million measles cases worldwide in 2023, an increase of 20% from 2022. Global immunization gaps are driving the surge in measles cases.\nMeasles can be prevented by two doses of measles vaccine. However, in 2023 more than 22 million children missed the first dose of the measles vaccine. It is estimated that last year globally 83% of children received the first dose of the measles vaccine, and only 74% of children received the recommended second dose.\nMeasles virus is one of the most contagious human viruses worldwide. To prevent outbreaks and protect people from this virus, two-dose measles vaccination coverage must reach 95% or higher in every country and in every community.\nDr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said, “In the past 50 years, more lives have been saved by the measles vaccine than by any other vaccine. To save more lives and prevent this deadly virus from harming the most vulnerable people, we must mobilize funds to vaccinate people around the world.”\nMandy Cohen, Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, “Global measles infections continue to rise, threatening human lives and health. The measles vaccine is the best protective tool we have against the measles virus. We must continue to invest and work to increase opportunities for people to receive immunizations.”\nDue to gaps in global vaccination coverage, in 2023 there were large-scale or severe measles outbreaks in 57 countries, and measles outbreaks occurred in every region except the Americas; the number of affected countries rose by nearly 60% from the previous year (36 countries). Cases rose sharply in the WHO Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, European, Southeast Asian, and Western Pacific regions. Nearly half of all large-scale or severe outbreaks occurred in the Africa region.\nNew data show that in 2023 an estimated 107,500 people died of measles, most of them children under five. Although this is an 8% reduction from the previous year, too many children still die from this preventable disease. The slight decrease in deaths is mainly because the surge in cases occurred in countries and regions where children’s nutrition and access to health care services are relatively high, and the likelihood of death from measles is lower.\nEven if measles patients survive, their health can be severely affected, with some impacts lasting lifelong. Infants and young children are most likely to experience severe complications such as blindness, pneumonia, and encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling and potential brain damage).\nAs measles cases rise and outbreaks increase, the world’s target of eradicating measles under the Immunization Agenda 2030 is threatened. By the end of 2023, 82 countries had achieved or maintained measles elimination targets. The WHO this week reaffirmed that Brazil has eliminated measles, meaning the WHO Region of the Americas has no endemic measles transmission. Within WHO regions, except for the Africa region, at least one country in each region has eliminated measles.\nCountries and global immunization partners, especially in the Africa and Eastern Mediterranean regions and in vulnerable, conflict-affected, and fragile settings, urgently need targeted work to vaccinate all children with two doses of measles vaccine. This requires implementing and sustaining efficient routine immunization programs and conducting high-quality, high-coverage vaccination campaigns when such programs are not sufficient to protect all children.\nCountries and global immunization partners must also strengthen disease surveillance, including expanding the global measles and rubella laboratory network. Strong disease surveillance is essential to optimize immunization planning and to detect and rapidly respond to measles outbreaks to mitigate their scale and impact.",

      "problem_en": "The heart is a muscular organ roughly the size of an adult’s fist. It sits in the chest cavity, more precisely in the space called the mediastinum between the two lungs. The heart is covered by a membrane called the pericardium, which separates the heart from the other structures of the mediastinum. This position enables the heart to perform its function: pumping oxygen-rich blood to the body and delivering deoxygenated blood to the lungs for gas exchange in the alveoli.\n\nThe heart consists of four chambers, broadly divided into the right heart (comprising the right atrium and right ventricle) and the left heart (comprising the left atrium and left ventricle). Each atrium has an appendage known as the atrial appendage, which can increase atrial capacity when needed.\n\nThe pathway of the body's circulation is roughly as follows: deoxygenated venous blood that has been used by body tissues returns from the body and tissues through the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava into the right atrium, then into the right ventricle, from which it is pumped into the pulmonary trunk and flows to the lungs for gas exchange. After the exchange in the alveoli, the blood is transformed into oxygen-rich arterial blood and returns from the lungs via four pulmonary veins to the left atrium; this process is called the “pulmonary circulation.” Then oxygenated blood enters the left ventricle, from which it is pumped into the aorta and reaches all body tissues and organs, which is the “systemic circulation.”\n\nAfter understanding the circulatory path, we now look at what constitutes the heart’s boundaries, which is very important because this knowledge is frequently used when reading radiographs.\n\nThe superior border of the heart is formed by the right atrium and the left atrium. Along the upper border, from right to left, the superior vena cava enters the right atrium. Then comes the ascending aorta, which arises from the left ventricle and then bends backward to form the aortic arch. Finally there is the pulmonary trunk and its two branches: the right pulmonary artery and the left pulmonary artery, with the right pulmonary artery located beneath the aortic arch. The inferior border is almost horizontal, mainly formed by parts of the right ventricle and left ventricle. The right border is formed by the right atrium, located between the superior and inferior vena cavae. The left border is mainly formed by the left ventricle and a portion of the left atrial appendage. Finally, the end of the inferior border and the lower part of the left border form the apex of the heart, which is the tip of the left ventricle.\n\nSome features of the heart boundaries can be seen on chest X-ray films. The contour of the heart can be clearly seen between the right border formed by the lung and right atrium and the left border formed by the left ventricle and part of the left atrial appendage. Above the left atrial appendage, we can identify the pulmonary artery and the aortic arch. However, the heart’s superior and inferior borders are not as easily distinguished as the left and right borders.\n\nNow, let us identify the heart’s structures from the front and back views. From right to left, the right heart consists of the right atrium and right ventricle. They are separated by the coronary sulcus (abbreviated AV groove). Then come the left atrial appendage and the left ventricle, which are also separated by the coronary groove. The right ventricle and left ventricle are separated by the anterior interventricular groove.\n\nNext, let’s look at the heart’s vascular portion. From right to left, this includes a portion of the superior vena cava opening into the upper part of the right atrium. Then is a portion of the inferior vena cava opening into the right atrium, though it can only be seen from the posterior aspect. Then the ascending aorta, which arises from the left ventricle and arches backward to form the aortic arch. The branches of the aortic arch can also be seen from right to left: first the brachiocephalic trunk, with its branches the right subclavian artery and the right common carotid artery, followed by the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery. Finally, on the inner side of the left atrial appendage is the pulmonary trunk, which arises from the right ventricle and branches into the right and left pulmonary arteries.\n\nInterestingly, the proximal left pulmonary artery is connected to the undersurface of the aortic arch by the ligamentum arteriosum. In embryonic development, it is a vessel that connects the aortic arch and the pulmonary trunk, serving to separate the fetal pulmonary and aortic blood flows and ensure normal fetal circulation. (If the ductus arteriosus has not closed within six months after birth, it is called patent ductus arteriosus.)\n\nNow, from the posterior view, we can see most of the left atrium and left atrial appendage, the left ventricle, and the right atrium and right ventricle. As mentioned earlier, the atria and ventricles are separated by the coronary sulcus, but now the left and right ventricles are separated by the posterior interventricular groove.\n\nAt the upper part, above the coronary sulcus, are the great vessels.

      "problem": "张先生是一位45岁的公司主管，工作繁忙的他总是忽视自己的健康，觉得自己还年轻，身体强壮，不用担心这些“小毛病”。\n但是最近几个月，他开始感觉胸口时不时地有些压迫感，尤其是在工作压力大的时候。朋友们都劝他去医院检查一下，但他总是笑着说：“没事儿，可能就是太累了，休息一下就好。”\n直到有一天，他突然在办公室晕倒，被紧急送往医院后，医生诊断他患有急性心肌梗死，尽管医生全力抢救，但张先生最终不幸离世。医生在复盘时感慨地说：“他有三次救命的机会，但都被他自己错过了。”\n这三次救命的机会是什么？如何才能避免像张先生这样的悲剧发生？让我们通过深入的医学科普来了解心肌梗死的预防与管理。\n心肌梗死，常被称为“心脏病发作”，是冠状动脉突然闭塞导致心肌缺血、坏死的一种严重心血管疾病。如果能够在早期发现并采取适当的预防措施，许多心肌梗死事件是可以避免的。\n张先生的悲剧正是因为他在生命中的三次关键时刻，没有正确识别和管理自己的心血管风险，错过了救命的机会。\n在2019年，美国的Arnett DK团队在《Circulation》杂志上发表了一篇名为《2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease》的研究。\n该研究为心血管疾病的初级预防提供了重要的指南，通过控制高血压、高胆固醇、糖尿病等心血管疾病的高风险因素，能够有效降低心肌梗死的发生率。\n在张先生的案例中，虽然他在年轻时没有明显的健康问题，但随着年龄的增长和生活压力的增加，血压和胆固醇水平逐渐升高，而这些都是心肌梗死的主要风险因素。\n定期进行体检并早期发现和管理这些风险因素，能够显著降低未来发生心肌梗死的概率。遗憾的是，张先生并没有重视这些“预警信号”，错过了第一次救命的机会。\n根据2018年加拿大Wijeysundera HC团队发表在《Canadian Medical Association Journal》上的研究《Cost-effectiveness of Cardiac Rehabilitation for Reducing Mortality in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease》。\n早期识别和干预是预防心肌梗死恶化的关键。许多患者在心肌梗死发生前数周甚至数月会出现一些前兆症状，如胸痛、气短、疲劳等。\n这些症状往往被患者忽视，认为是由于疲劳或压力所致，但实际上，它们可能是心脏病发作的早期信号。\n张先生正是因为忽视了这些早期症状，认为自己只是“太累了”，没有及时就医，导致病情逐渐恶化。\n如果患者能够在出现这些早期症状时立即就医，并接受适当的检查和治疗，可以极大降低心肌梗死的风险。张先生的第二次救命机会也因此失去了。\n2016年，德国的Steg PG团队在《European Heart Journal》上发表的《ESC Guidelines for the management of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation》一文中提到，长期的心血管风险管理对于预防心肌梗死的复发至关重要。\n心血管疾病高风险患者应坚持定期复诊，进行血脂、血压等指标的监测，并根据需要调整治疗方案，以确保心脏健康的长期稳定。\n张先生由于忙于工作，长期处于高压状态，缺乏运动，饮食不规律，加上吸烟等不良习惯，这些因素进一步增加了他发生心肌梗死的风险。\n即使他在某个阶段接受了治疗，但未能坚持长期管理，最终错过了第三次救命的机会。基于上述研究和张先生的故事，我们可以得出以下几个预防心肌梗死的重要建议：\n定期体检，早期发现风险：无论是否有明显症状，40岁以上的成年人应定期进行体检，尤其是血压、胆固醇和血糖等心血管风险因素的监测。早期发现问题，及时采取预防措施，是避免心肌梗死的第一道防线。\n重视身体信号，及时就医：任何胸痛、气短、极度疲劳等不适症状都不应被忽视，特别是当这些症状在运动或压力下加重时，应立即就医。早期的干预和治疗可以大大降低心肌梗死的风险。\n坚持长期管理，改善生活方式：心血管疾病的预防不仅仅是短期内的治疗，还需要长期的管理。这包括坚持健康的饮食、规律的运动、戒烟限酒、保持心理健康等。此外，定期复诊和根据医生建议调整治疗方案也是必要的。\n张先生的故事告诉我们，心肌梗死的预防并非难以企及，而是在于我们能否在生活中重视那些微小的变化，并积极采取行动来保护自己的健康。\n请根据以上文章取一个微信公众号的标题，要求20字以内",

      "problem_en": "Mr. Zhang is a 45-year-old company manager who, due to his busy work, constantly neglects his health, thinking he is still young and physically strong, and that there is no need to worry about these “little problems.”\n\nBut in the past few months, he began to feel occasional pressure in his chest, especially under high work stress. Friends urged him to go to the hospital for a check-up, but he always smiled and said, “It’s nothing, maybe I’m just tired; a rest will do.”\n\nUntil one day, he suddenly fainted in the office, was rushed to the hospital, and was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction. Despite full resuscitation efforts, Mr. Zhang ultimately passed away. In a retrospective review, the doctor lamented: “He had three lifesaving opportunities, but he missed them all himself.”\n\nWhat were these three lifesaving opportunities? How can tragedies like Mr. Zhang’s be avoided? Let us understand the prevention and management of myocardial infarction through in-depth medical science education.\n\nMyocardial infarction, often referred to as a “heart attack,” is a serious cardiovascular disease caused by sudden occlusion of the coronary artery leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis. If detected early and appropriate preventive measures are taken, many myocardial infarction events can be prevented.\n\nMr. Zhang’s tragedy was precisely because at three critical moments in his life he did not properly recognize and manage his cardiovascular risk, thus missing lifesaving opportunities.\n\nIn 2019, a team led by Arnett DK from the United States published in Circulation a study titled “2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease.” This study provides important guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease; by controlling high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors, it can effectively reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction.\n\nIn Mr. Zhang’s case, although he had no obvious health problems at a younger age, as he aged and life pressure increased, his blood pressure and cholesterol levels gradually rose, and these are major risk factors for myocardial infarction. Regular health checkups and early detection and management of these risk factors can significantly reduce the probability of future myocardial infarction. Unfortunately, Mr. Zhang did not take these “early warning signs” seriously, missing the first lifesaving opportunity.\n\nAccording to a 2018 study by Wijeysundera HC and team from Canada, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, “Cost-effectiveness of Cardiac Rehabilitation for Reducing Mortality in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.” Early identification and intervention are key to preventing myocardial infarction from worsening. Many patients may experience warning symptoms weeks or even months before a myocardial infarction, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.\n\nThese symptoms are often ignored by patients, who attribute them to fatigue or stress; in fact, they may be early signals of a heart attack. Mr. Zhang missed these early symptoms, thinking he was just “too tired,” and did not seek timely medical care, leading to a gradual deterioration. If patients seek medical attention promptly when these early symptoms appear and undergo appropriate examinations and treatment, the risk of myocardial infarction can be greatly reduced. Mr. Zhang’s second lifesaving opportunity was thus lost as well.\n\nIn 2016, Steg PG and team from Germany published in the European Heart Journal the article “ESC Guidelines for the management of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation,” which mentions that long-term cardiovascular risk management is crucial for preventing recurrence of myocardial infarction. High-risk cardiovascular patients should adhere to regular follow-up visits, monitor lipid levels, blood pressure, and other indicators, and adjust treatment as needed to ensure long-term cardiac health.\n\nMr. Zhang, being busy with work, remained under sustained high stress, lacked exercise, had an irregular diet, and engaged in unhealthy habits such as smoking; these factors further increased his risk of myocardial infarction. Even if he received treatment at some stage, he failed to adhere to long-term management, ultimately missing the third lifesaving opportunity. Based on the above studies and Mr. Zhang’s story, we can derive several important recommendations for preventing myocardial infarction:\n\nRegular medical checkups, early risk detection: Regardless of symptoms, adults over 40 should undergo regular health assessments, especially monitoring cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose. Early detection and timely preventive measures are the first line of defense against myocardial infarction.\n\nHeed bodily signals and seek medical care promptly: Any chest pain, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, or other discomfort should not be ignored, especially if these symptoms worsen with exercise or stress; seek medical care immediately. Early intervention and treatment can greatly reduce the risk of myocardial infarction.\n\nMaintain long-term management and improve lifestyle: Prevention of cardiovascular disease is not only about short-term treatment but requires long-term management. This includes adherence to a healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol, maintaining mental health, etc. Additionally, regular follow-ups and adjusting treatment according to the doctor’s guidance are necessary.\n\nMr. Zhang’s story teaches us that the prevention of myocardial infarction is not unattainable; it depends on whether we pay attention to those small changes in daily life and take proactive actions to protect our health.\n\nPlease generate a WeChat public account title based on the above article, within 20 Chinese characters.",

Therefore, ordinary cooking temperatures (100–200°C) cannot destroy them, and do not expect boiling water or frying to kill them.\n\nWhich foods are prone to contamination?\n\nAflatoxins are not only toxic, but widely present in daily life; they tend to hide in these foods and places:\n\n➤ Moldy grains\nRice, millet, corn, beans, and other starch-rich grains.\n\n➤ Moldy peanuts and nuts\nPeanuts and nuts are rich in fats; aflatoxin is soluble in fats, so they are prone to aflatoxin contamination.\n\n➤ Low-quality sesame paste\nSome vendors, to cut costs, use bran sesame, shriveled peanuts, or spoiled sesame and peanuts as raw materials, and among spoiled peanuts, aflatoxins can be present.\n\n➤ Small workshop oil pressing\nSome peanuts look normal on the outside, but aflatoxin has formed inside; small workshop oil presses have simple processes and lack procedures to remove harmful substances, cannot refine the raw materials, and may have pesticide residues, heavy metal contamination, and aflatoxins.\n\n➤ Refrigerators that are not cleaned regularly\nFood stored in the fridge for long periods can mold; aflatoxins and other bacteria can proliferate.\n\n➤ Wooden cutting boards, wooden chopsticks\nGaps in cutting boards and chopsticks can hide food residues; if not cleaned properly after use, or left for a long time in damp, dark corners, mold can easily develop.\n\nHow to prevent aflatoxin production?\n\n➤ Handle moldy foods promptly\nIf moldy rice, peanuts, nuts, etc. are found at home, discard them promptly, and do not eat any leftovers.\n\n➤ Store foods properly\nGrains, nuts, etc. should be kept in a dry, ventilated place to avoid mold from improper storage; in addition, do not overstock food at home to reduce aflatoxin exposure risk.\n\n➤ Pay attention to kitchen utensil hygiene\nChopsticks, cutting boards, and other utensils should be cleaned promptly and replaced regularly to prevent bacterial growth.\n\nSummarize the author’s view on aflatoxins in three sentences or fewer.",
      "answer_en": "The author's core view on aflatoxins is that aflatoxins are extremely dangerous fungal toxins with high toxicity and carcinogenicity, and that even the high temperatures of everyday cooking cannot destroy them. Therefore, the public should be highly vigilant and take measures such as promptly handling moldy foods, properly storing foods, and maintaining hygiene of kitchen utensils to prevent the production and ingestion of aflatoxins, thereby protecting health.",

      "problem_en": "Today we talk about the nemesis of keloids—the Strontium-90 patch. This is a treatment that is both magical and professional, making those stubborn keloids hard to hide. Although its name sounds a little like a “miracle tool” from a sci‑fi movie, it is actually not far from our daily life.\n\nKeloids are a common skin problem, especially more prevalent in Asian populations. This may be related to genetic factors, skin type, and the healing process after injury. Globally, the incidence of keloids is about 5%–15%, with women being more affected. These stubborn scars not only affect appearance but can also cause pain, itching, and other discomfort, and may negatively impact the patient’s mental health.\n\nThe Strontium-90 patch is a radiotherapy method. It uses the beta radiation emitted by the radioactive isotope Strontium-90 to act precisely on scar tissue and inhibit its proliferation. This treatment method has gained wide attention and application for its non-invasiveness and high efficacy. The treatment usually requires multiple irradiations; after the course ends, scar tissue proliferation is markedly reduced, and the patient’s skin appearance and comfort improve.\n\nScar formation is part of the body's self‑repair process and is a complex biological event. It is typically caused by skin injury, surgery, burns, infections, and other factors. When the skin is damaged, the body initiates repair mechanisms to close the wound and prevent infection and blood loss. First, when the skin is injured, the body rapidly coagulates to form a clot to seal the wound. This process is usually accompanied by an inflammatory response, with leukocytes and other immune cells gathering at the wound site to clear potential sources of infection and damaged tissue. After that, fibroblasts begin to accumulate at the wound site, synthesizing and depositing extracellular matrix components locally to repair the wound, and playing a major role in the contraction of local granulation tissue. When repair is completed, fibroblasts undergo apoptosis and disappear. But if local regulation is unstable, fibroblasts may persist, and granulation tissue remodeling may be damaged, leading to proliferative or keloid scar formation. The appearance and texture of the scar may differ significantly from surrounding normal skin, depending on the amount and arrangement of collagen fibers. In addition, scar formation is influenced by other factors such as age, skin color, genetics, the depth and size of the wound, and whether infection occurred during healing.\n\nDuring the scar formation process, the skin also undergoes remodeling and maturation. Initially, scars may be red or pink; over time they flatten and fade. However, some scars, especially keloids and hypertrophic scars, may continue to proliferate, forming raised, thick nodules that often require medical intervention.\n\nKeloids are not just “marks after wound healing.” They are like mischievous children that continue to proliferate, never stopping, as if they have a life of their own. Keloids not only affect appearance and make the skin feel uneven, but can also cause discomfort such as itching and pain. They can occur anywhere on the body and, wherever they exist, they remain a persistent presence, constantly reminding you of their stubbornness. Treatment is not simple and requires special care and treatment approaches that many people worry about.\n\nSo how does the Strontium-90 patch deal with these persistent keloids? Strontium-90 is a radioactive isotope that releases a beta radiation force. This radiation can penetrate the epidermis and reach the base of the keloid, delivering a stern “lesson” to those “unruly” cells. Specifically, these rays can suppress fibroblasts within the keloid, causing them to stop proliferating wildly, thereby achieving the therapeutic effect.\n\nYou might wonder, “With such a powerful treatment, isn’t the process complicated?” In fact, it is very simple.\n\nFirst, preparation. The clinician will first clean the keloid area with sterile saline, then cut a suitable rubber mold according to the size of the keloid to protect surrounding normal skin.\n\nNext is the treatment. Gently apply the Strontium-90 patch onto the keloid to ensure full coverage. The patch is usually fixed for a period of time, the exact duration depending on the severity and area of the scar, generally from a few minutes to over ten minutes.\n\nFinally, after the patch is removed, the skin is cleaned, and you can go home. The whole process is painless and quick, with almost no discomfort.\n\nThe effect of the Strontium-90 patch is quite significant. After a few treatments, the keloid will gradually flatten, the color will lighten, and the itching and pain will lessen. Of course, this is not a one‑time “miracle cure”; multiple treatments may be needed to achieve the best result. But compared with other treatments, the Strontium-90 patch is undoubtedly an efficient choice with relatively few side effects.\n\nAlthough the Strontium-90 patch is effective, it is still a radiotherapy, so there are some adverse reactions to watch for. In the days following treatment, some patients may experience mild local redness, swelling, or peeling. These are normal and generally do not require special management; under a doctor’s guidance, you can use moisturizers or anti‑inflammatory ointments. Some patients may develop pigment changes (skin darkening) at the treated site. This is usually temporary and gradually resolves over time. Although this is relatively rare, if not handled properly or if a person’s constitution is poor, there may be a risk of infection. Therefore, after treatment, it is important to keep the affected area clean, avoid rubbing and irritation, and seek medical care promptly if there are signs of infection (redness, swelling, warmth, and increasing pain).\n\nMany people, upon hearing “radioactivity,” associate it with nuclear power plants or radiation pollution. In reality, the radiation dose from Strontium-90 patches is very low and strictly controlled within safety limits. Moreover, the treatment time is short, and the patch area is small, so the radiation’s impact on the body is minimal. Doctors also take a series of protective measures during the procedure to ensure safety. So there is no need to worry—your health is fully protected.\n\nAs an innovative method for treating keloids, Strontium-90 patches offer high efficiency, simplicity, and low side effects, and are becoming a choice for more and more people. Whether a scar is visually bothersome or causes itching and pain, the Strontium-90 patch can handle it with ease. If you are troubled by keloids, consider this remarkable treatment; perhaps you’ll say goodbye to those pesky bumps very soon.",

If regulation is unstable, proliferative scars or keloids may form🤔。\n\n**Keloids: A Stubborn 'Little Demon'**  \n😣Keloids are not ordinary scars; they keep proliferating, affect appearance, and cause discomfort, making treatment troublesome and frustrating😖！\n\n**The Treatment Process of Strontium-90 Patches**  \n💡The treatment process is not complicated; first, clean the scar area and protect surrounding normal skin with a rubber mold🤔。  \n🌟Then apply the patch to the keloid; the duration is determined by the situation; finally remove the patch and clean the skin—painless and quick🎉。\n\n**👏 Remarkable Effects of Strontium-90 Patches**  \nAfter several treatments, the keloid will flatten, the color lightens, and itching and pain decrease. While not resolved in a single session, it is more effective than other methods with fewer side effects 😜！\n\n**Adverse Reactions and Precautions of Strontium-90 Patches**  \n😜After treatment, there may be local skin redness or peeling; this is normal and moisturizers or anti-inflammatory ointments can be used💡。  \n🌟Pigmentation may also occur, but it usually resolves; if there are signs of infection, seek medical attention promptly😏。\n\n**Safety of Strontium-90 Patches**  \n🙅Although it is radiotherapy, the dose is low, within a safe range, the treatment time is short, the treated area is small, and the impact on the body is minimal😎！\n\n**Choose Strontium-90 Patches to Bid Farewell to Keloids**  \n🤗Strontium-90 patches are efficient, simple, and have low side effects; more and more people are choosing them. If you are troubled by keloids, try them and say goodbye to the lumps😘。\n\n✨ #Keloids #Strontium-90 Patch #SkinProblems #RadiationTherapy #TreatmentMethods",

Was the swelling severe then? Is it swollen now as it was then? Is blood pressure high? Are your calves tender when pressed?\nIn late pregnancy there was some calf edema but not very obvious, it resolved after a sleep. Now about 14–15 days postpartum, the calves are swollen again, worse than before. Blood pressure, I measured with a wrist cuff; not sure if accurate, 116/72. Some areas of the calves are tender to touch. Oh my, this is quite worrying. Are you still receiving heparin?\nStopped; after discharge the doctor told me not to continue.\nYou should be careful; you may have a hypercoagulable state, i.e., prone to thrombosis. Edema caused by hypertension usually subsides after delivery and rarely worsens. There are two possible possibilities: 1) calf thrombosis, 2) possible kidney problems. Please return to the postpartum clinic for follow-up: measure blood pressure, check urine, test renal function, and perform an ultrasound of the calves. Also, the heart should be checked for reassurance.\nOh dear, so troublesome. I still have eight days until the full month; can I wait until then to check? Would that be too late?\nNo, if there is real thrombosis in the calf, delaying is not an option; a clot could break off and cause a pulmonary embolism, which can be fatal. You must seek evaluation promptly.\nWhich specialty should I go to? Genetics or high-risk clinic okay?\nYes, either is fine. When you go, tell the doctor your situation, and they will arrange the necessary tests.\nDirector Chen, if it turns out to be calf thrombosis, how is it treated?\nIf it is truly a thrombosis, treatment may involve medication or surgery, depending on the case. But you must first undergo testing to confirm.\nOkay, I’ll go to the hospital tomorrow, thank you, doctor.\nYou’re welcome. The sooner you go for evaluation and treatment, the better for your health.

Based on the information you provided, the recommendations are: head trauma.\n\nWhat did you hit at the time?\n\nCould you take a photo of the lump at that spot?\n\nI fell to the ground.\n\nIs the area where the lump formed painful?\n\nThere is no wound; the swelling has subsided; taking photos shows nothing.\n\nIs it in the forehead, temple, or occipital region?\n\nI hit the skull, but in the past two days the pain has been on the left side of the head.\n\nIt’s above the ear.\n\nIs the left-sided pain the entire left side of the head? A sense of pressure? scalp pain or pain inside the brain?\n\nIt feels like a nerve is hurting.\n\nThis isn’t severe, right? I’m anxious.\n\nWas it a slip-and-fall or another cause?\n\nI read online that it takes at least a month to heal.\n\nAs long as there’s nothing wrong inside the brain, it should gradually get better.\n\nIt was raining at the time.\n\nI fell down.\n\nNot fainting, right? Do you know how I fell?\n\nSo can you tell me whether there’s anything wrong inside my brain now?\n\nHave you had a head CT?\n\nFrom the symptoms alone, it’s not possible to judge accurately.\n\nNo, not done.\n\nIt was probably slipping on the ground while walking in the rain.\n\nThen you don’t remember; I’d suggest doing a CT for safety. The left side shouldn’t hurt, to confirm there’s no injury on the left?\n\nI fainted for less than a minute at the time and should have woken up.\n\nThen the headaches are slowly getting better, but I want them to improve quickly.\n\nBe more careful; if it doesn’t keep improving, you should do a CT to prevent delayed treatment.\n\nRight.\n\nThe right-side lump area is now a little tender to touch, not much else.\n\nThere is a type of injury called contrecoup injury, where the right side of the head is injured and there is contusion with laceration on the left side of the brain.\n\nIt’s just strange why the left side hurts.\n\nSo what should I take now?\n\nOnline sources say it could be a mild concussion, which might not require going to the hospital—just rest and monitor.\n\nConcussion symptoms aside from the initial injury are usually mild; however, there might be no visible wound on the head.\n\nContinue to observe; if it gets better, it may be nothing serious. If it doesn’t improve, get a CT scan.\n\nWhat should I take now, and for how long should I take it before I go to the hospital again if it doesn’t improve?\n\nThere aren’t any special medications; analgesics are for symptomatic relief.\n\nIf it isn’t very painful, you may not need to take medicine; if it’s very painful, further investigations are needed.\n\nIf it’s a contrecoup injury, what symptoms would occur?\n\nThen should you not take any medicine?\n\nAre you nauseated?\n\nPersistent headaches can be accompanied by dizziness, forgetfulness, nausea, vomiting, etc.\n\nIn the two days after the injury I felt nauseous and wanted to vomit, but didn’t actually vomit. It hasn’t happened since.\n\nKeep observing.\n\nNausea and vomiting suggest there may be something to vomit, right?\n\nHow long should I observe for?\n\nCan I take Zhongshengwan?\n\nVomiting doesn’t always bring anything up.\n\nNot particularly meaningful.\n\nThere’s no strict time limit for observation; if symptoms worsen, seek timely medical attention.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nIf it’s just a normal lump from a bump, how long does it usually take to heal?\n\nIt depends on the size of the lump; most cases resolve in about two weeks.\n\nI suppose the contusion with laceration isn’t severe; there’s no vomiting, just a headache.\n\nNot necessarily a contusion with laceration; it’s just a possibility.\n\nIt shouldn’t be very severe pain either.\n\nRight.",

I have read the medical information in detail. Based on your current data, the suggestions are: Hello\nThank you for your trust—I've reviewed the medical information carefully. Based on your situation, here is my input. Hello, I delivered by cesarean on September 27, and on December 24, the blood test showed total thyroxine and free thyroxine were a bit low. Is this serious? Will it affect my baby during pregnancy? Doctor, are you there? Why aren’t you replying to me? Did you fall asleep? Hello, sorry, I just went to the bathroom. Generally, if you have early subacute thyroiditis (thyroiditis) or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, total thyroxine can be low in the early stage.\nDuring pregnancy, I think thyroid function tests were done at prenatal checkups; the doctor didn’t say much, the form was taken away by the community. What else do I need to check? What disease is this? Will it affect my baby during pregnancy? My baby is six months old today, about 25 jin (approx. 12.5 kg). Is that related? Then perhaps your thyroid function at that time was normal. So regular follow-up is needed. If thyroid function during pregnancy is abnormal, it can affect the baby.\nMy baby’s birth heel-prick TSH was 10; later recheck was 3.59. The jaundice lasted a long time. I’m now worried that my indices will affect the baby. That would suggest the thyroid function was normal at the time of recheck; currently the impact on the baby isn’t large. Then what do I need to check? I have multinodular cystic-solid thyroid nodules. You need to regularly monitor thyroid function and ultrasound. Eat more vegetables, fruits, and protein-rich foods.\nHow often should I recheck? Every two to three weeks. Do the two diseases you mentioned cure? They are curable. If there’s neck pain or palpitations, treat symptomatically. If not, continue observing with regular follow-up. Subacute thyroiditis and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.\nBesides follow-up, what else do I need to check to determine what disease it is? I’m currently in the pandemic period and don’t dare go to the hospital. It’s hard to say now. There are many causes of low total thyroxine; besides those two, some medications can cause low levels, and Cushing’s syndrome can too.\nAre you saying thyroid function tests every two to three weeks? Should ultrasound be every six months or every year? What does my baby need to be checked for? Will my indices return to normal? Yes, thyroid function tests every two to three weeks; ultrasound every six months or every year. Ask the pediatrician what your baby needs to be checked. Most people can recover to normal; eat more vegetables and fruits, strengthen immunity, and have regular thyroid function monitoring.\nDuring pregnancy’s early stage, I used IVF gel and estradiol, and haven’t used other medications since. Then pay attention to diet and regular follow-up. Okay, thank you; good rest. You’re welcome.",

      "problem_en": "Description\nDisease:\nDwarfism\nClinical description:\nDirector Pan, hello, my daughter was born full-term on 2007-08-11, 3.6 kg, in good health but short. Growth hormone treatment began on 2018-07-27 when her apparent age was 11, bone age 11, height 138 cm. During treatment she started her first period on 2019-10-18. After 20 months of treatment, she is now 156 cm tall, bone age a little over 13 years, weight 45 kg. Local doctors say reaching 160 cm is still a bit difficult; after so long and at a cost, they still hope to reach 162 cm, but time is not on our side. Reading some of your answers, I saw you mentioned that for children with advanced bone age combination therapy might be used. I’m not sure if my daughter is suitable or if there are other options, awaiting your reply. Please see if this photo is clearer.\nHelp sought:\nWhether combination therapy is possible\nDuration of disease:\nMore than half a year\nHospital and department visited:\nZhejiang Provincial Children's Hospital Endocrinology\nMedications:\nGrowth hormone 8 units\nAllergies:\nNone (2020-03-27)\nPast medical history:\nNone (2020-03-27)\nHello! Thank you for your trust! Because this is a Q&A format, it is not convenient to upload relevant articles in the first reply; this is a simple textual reply for now, and later we will help you add consults. Please wait for a detailed reply.\n\nDialogue\nDoctor:\nThe clarity of the bone age radiograph is limited; the assessment results are for reference. A detailed bone age assessment requires scoring every bone on the bone age radiograph, and the assessment should consider not only the size and morphology of the physes, and their relationship with other bones, but also the overlapping shadows on the palms and the back of the hands. Therefore, the clarity requirement is very high. In this reply, there are samples of bone age reports from other children for reference.\n\nFrom the bone age film the date is not clearly visible; currently, a preliminary assessment suggests bone age around 12.8 years (TW3 method, RUS score 758). A rough prediction of adult height can refer to normal height tables or growth charts (the back of the normal height tables and growth charts contain text describing the basic method of predicting adult height).\n\nIf the bone age film is indeed the most recent, and the height at imaging time is already 165 cm, the predicted adult height is already quite good. A bone age of 12.8 years means you can only compare with a 12.8-year-old girl in terms of height. The average height for a 12.8-year-old girl is 155.6 cm, and the average adult height for girls around 160.6 cm means there is on average about 5 cm of natural growth remaining. If your child is determined to reach 162 cm, there is only about a 6 cm gap. To turn a 5 cm potential into 6 cm, using growth hormone alone would be sufficient; there is no need to combine with other drugs. 《How to Assess Bone Age in Detail?》： 《Normal Height Standards for Boys and Girls of Different Ages》： 《Chinese SDS charts for height and weight in 2–18-year-old girls》：\n\nDialogue\nDoctor:\nOf course, the same drug, but different methods of use and dosing, as well as later dose adjustments and safety monitoring, may lead to notably different efficacy and safety. If a refined treatment plan can be used, it may achieve better results. During the treatment, proper safety monitoring may also reduce adverse effects. For specifics, please refer to the article on my website homepage 《Indications for Recombinant Human Growth Hormone and Efficacy Analyses by Etiology》 and 《Indications for Recombinant Human Growth Hormone (rhGH) and Efficacy by Etiology》:\n\nDialogue\nPatient:\nThank you for your reply, Dr Pan. Bone age was taken on March 21; height was measured around 10 am that day. First question, bone age: since the injections started on July 27, 2018, we have had bone age checks every three months; bone age has always lagged behind actual age by about one year, but recently this time the doctor said it was a bit over 13, and the bone age jumped a lot. Does this indicate that bone age growth will accelerate in the near future? Local doctors say there may only be 3–5 months of growth left; at what bone age will growth typically arrest? Second question: is there growth hormone resistance? In the first year she grew about 12 cm, in the second year 8 months she grew 6 cm; several friends with the condition have this, and in the second year the effect declines. In that case, within five or six months would she only gain about 4 cm? Third question: how should exercise be coordinated with injections? Currently she does 2000 jump ropes daily, sometimes doing pull-ups, weekends she goes hiking for two hours and sweats; what other good forms of exercise can you suggest? Fourth question: the girl is very picky with food; is that a problem? Thank you.\nPatient:\nBone age photo is not clear, please re-upload for Dr Pan to check again.\nDoctor:\nNowadays many hospitals still use GP bone age atlas from the 1950s. The accuracy is limited; when the navicular bone hasn't appeared yet they say the bone age is small, when it appears they say the bone age is 13. Recently height growth has slowed; if puberty development does not progress quickly, a sole advance in bone age may not be large. I have assessed your child’s case as not reaching 13 yet, as previously stated.\n\nCurrently domestic growth hormones are all fifth generation, resistance issues are less common. Different developmental states, different bone ages, and different periods may require adjustment of treatment plans. The same drug with different usage methods and dosages, and later dosage adjustments and safety monitoring, can have noticeably different effects and safety. If a refined treatment plan can be used, better results may be possible. During treatment, safety monitoring can also reduce side effects. For details, please refer to my website homepage article 《Indications for Recombinant Human Growth Hormone and Efficacy Analyses by Etiology》 and 《Bone Age Assessment (Testing) and Adult Height Prediction》 and 《Growth Hormone Therapy for Dwarfism Children with Growth Hormone Deficiency, Precocious Puberty: Diet, Sleep, Exercise》:\n\nDialogue\nPatient:\nAfter viewing many of your consult cases, I found that your growth hormone treatment recommendations involve taking 14 injections and stopping for one day, or 20 days and stopping for one day. Why stop for one day? People around me seem to inject daily.\n\nDoctor:\nThe product specifications are limited, but body weight varies. 5 units with a 10-day cycle, stopping for 1 day translates to an average of about 4.54 units/day. When GH was originally tested clinically, it was a weekly dose divided into 6–7 days of injections.\n\nid=258\n\n\nDoctor faculty\nWuhu First People's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Endocrinology\n\nDescription\nDisease:\nChildhood-onset short stature\nClinical description:\n● Cheng**: born 2019-02-09, currently 11 years 1 month old, full-term, no hypoxia. ● At age 8, the girl developed a small breast lump; successive visits to Zhongshan Boai Hospital resulted in a normal diagnosis under regular follow-up. On 2020-03-09, at an 11-year-old 1-month height check, adult height predicted to be 156 cm; this was hard for the family to accept; if development is normal, they hope for a hereditary height (158 cm), and their target is above 162 cm. The child’s current height is 147.5 cm; in the past year she has grown about 6 cm. ● The child was born 2019-02-09; birth height/weight were 50 cm and 3.75 kg; height thereafter has remained around the 50th percentile. ● Diet normal; loves snacks; sleeping recently often late (often until 11 pm); exercise: swimming once a week; intelligence normal; no hepatitis, nephritis, brain injury, or other medical history; has never used growth-related drugs or supplements; father height 171 cm, mother 157 cm; no family history of early or late development; no tumors, diabetes, genetic disease, etc. For this visit at Zhongshan Boai Hospital, doctors also judged normal and no treatment required, but seeing the child’s budding puberty, they are worried about missing the final growth opportunity and wish Pan to provide a detailed diagnosis of the bone age, approximate onset of menstruation, final height, whether treatment is necessary to increase final height, and how to treat.\nHelp sought:\nPan, please tell us the current bone age of the child? Roughly when will menstruation occur and what final adult height is predicted if treatment is considered to raise adult height, and how to treat if we want to improve final height.\nDuration of disease:\nMore than half a year\nHospital and department visited:\nZhongshan BoAi Hospital, Pediatric Health Department\nAllergies:\nNone (2020-03-27)\nPast medical history:\nNone (2020-03-27)\nHello! Thank you for your trust! Because this is a Q&A format, it is not convenient to upload articles in the first reply; this is a simple text reply, and we will help you add more consults later. Please wait for a detailed reply.\n\nDialogue\nDoctor:\nThe clarity of the bone age film is limited; the assessment results are for reference. Detailed evaluation requires scoring each bone on the bone age film; when assessing, one must look at epiphyseal size, shape, and its relation to other bones, as well as the overlapping shadows on the palmar and dorsal hands piece, so the clarity requirement is high. This response is followed by bone age reports from other children for reference.\n\nCurrently, preliminary bone age is around 12.1 years (TW3 method, RUS score 688). A rough prediction of adult height can refer to the normal height tables or growth curves (the back pages provide the basic methods for predicting adult height).\n\nIf the bone age is indeed 12.1 years, the height can only be compared to 12.1-year-old girls. The average height of 12.1-year-old girls is 152.8 cm; compared to the average adult height of 160.6 cm for girls, there is on average 7.8 cm of natural growth remaining. If your child wants to strive toward 162 cm, there is still a gap of 14.5 cm. To turn 7.8 cm into 14.5 cm, there is certainly some difficulty. But if the bone age growth is not too fast, if menarche is not too early, starting growth hormone alone early still holds some hope. To achieve good treatment results, a refined plan is required from multiple aspects.\n\nBut again, the same drug has different usage methods and doses, and there are also dose adjustments and safety monitoring in the later course; different methods may have significant differences in effect and safety. If refined treatment can be used, better outcomes may be possible. During treatment, proper safety monitoring can also reduce adverse effects. For details, see my website homepage articles 《Indications for Recombinant Human Growth Hormone and Efficacy by Etiology》 and 《How to Assess Bone Age in Detail?》 and 《Normal Height Standards for Boys and Girls by Age》 and 《Chinese 2–18-year-old Boys’ Height and Weight SDS Chart》:\n\nDialogue\nDoctor:\nGirls have a normal age for menarche around a bone age of about 12.5 years, but from breast development to menarche, fast development is less than a year; slow development can be 4–5 years. The accuracy of predicting menarche is low. Menarche is influenced not only by bone age but also by pubertal development status (menarche typically occurs after breast development in stage B4), uterine lining thickness, follicle size, season (about half of girls have menarche in summer), etc. In early-developing children, each year of age does not necessarily correspond to a year of bone age, making menarche prediction even less accurate. 《Normal Pubertal Development and Precocious Puberty》:\n\nDialogue\nPatient:\nPan, a refined treatment plan requires a face-to-face evaluation by you, right? Also you mentioned single-use growth hormone because the child’s bone age is over 12 and suppressive injections have no effect, is that right?\n\nDoctor:\nBoth refined treatment and convenience are difficult; a face-to-face examination is necessary. Refined treatment is not simple; it requires a detailed case history, careful physical examination, accurate bone age assessment, pubertal development assessment, and growth response assessment, as well as pre-treatment stimulation tests and before/after comparisons. Of course, the treating physician's experience, patience, and wisdom are essential.\n\nThe girl’s bone age is greater than 12.5 years; GnRH agonist suppression is not indicated. In special circumstances, GnRH agonist treatment indications can be appropriately relaxed.

Menarche prediction is not very precise and is influenced by bone age and pubertal status (menarche typically occurs after B4 stage, uterine lining thickness, follicle size, season—about half of girls have menarche in summer), etc. Early puberty is such that age increases by one year does not always correspond to a year of bone age growth; thus, prediction accuracy for menarche is low. 《Normal Pubertal Development and Precocious Puberty》:\n\nDialogue\nPatient:\nPan, does a refined treatment plan require an in-person consultation? Also you mentioned single-use growth hormone because the child’s bone age is over 12 and suppressive injections are no longer effective—is that correct?\n\nDoctor:\nA refined treatment plan and convenience are both challenging; in-person consultation is needed. Refined treatment is not simple; it requires detailed medical history and thorough physical examination, precise bone age assessment, growth and development assessment, and efficacy evaluation, as well as pre-treatment stimulation tests and pre/post-treatment comparisons.

      "problem_en": "Description\nDisease:\nArrhythmia; premature beats\n\nClinical Description:\nThe patient is a 19-year-old female. In 2010, for congenital heart disease with double outlet right ventricle, she underwent a total cavopulmonary connection (Fontan procedure) at Beijing Anzhen Hospital. Preoperatively, radiofrequency ablation was performed to abolish pre-excitation. Since surgery she has been relatively well. Currently, oxygen saturation is about 90–95%, heart rate 75–85 bpm. In the past six months she began to feel arrhythmias and a sense of palpitations. On October 5, she had a 24-hour Holter at Luzhou Southwest Medical University Affiliated Hospital, which showed junctional premature beats and neurotic symptoms. On November 5, an ECG was performed at Wenjiang District People’s Hospital; on November 10 she felt the heart was not comfortable, and on November 15, a Holter at Chengdu Fifth People’s Hospital yielded conclusions broadly similar to the previous two tests. Sometimes the heart remains uncomfortable for several hours; occasionally there is a noticeable stabbing pain; ectopic beats are clearly felt; breathing may be slightly faster. I looked on Baidu that T-wave inversion is indicative of myocardial ischemia; SDNN was 54, which is low. Because I could not see a doctor at the time, I asked on the Chunyu Doctor app; the doctor said that at present only medication for regulation is needed, there is no need to focus on myocardial ischemia, and treatment should target neurofunctional disorders. They advised taking guwei su (谷维素), vitamin B1, Wenxin Granules (稳心颗粒), and Zhenyuan Capsules (振源胶囊) for one month; the number of premature beats is not high, so there is no need for further monitoring, and coronary disease is not considered. Could you help me determine whether this medication plan is appropriate? If it is acceptable, or if an adjustment to the treatment plan is needed, please issue a prescription. Thank you.\n\nAllergies:\nNone\n\nPast Medical History:\nSurgical history: In 2010 underwent a congenital heart disease operation—right ventricular double outlet with bidirectional Glenn procedure.\n\nDialogue\nDoctor:\nAfter reviewing the Holter, the mean heart rate is relatively fast, there is junctional premature beat, but I did not see the echocardiography report. If there was no echocardiography check in the past 1–2 years, it is worthwhile to perform an echocardiogram to assess structural and functional status. If symptoms are prominent, consider adding either bisoprolol fumarate or metoprolol, 0.5 to 1 tablet daily, to keep the heart rate around 70.\n\nPatient:\nI uploaded an echocardiogram from March 2018. I currently have metoprolol at home; when there are no ectopic beats, the heart rate is normal. I’m unsure whether I should take the medication and for how long. Do you recommend I take metoprolol? I heard that ST changes are not suitable for beta-blockers; can it be changed to a different drug, such as digoxin?\n\nDoctor:\nHello! Occasional ventricular ectopy is not strongly associated; generally, balance activity and rest, regulate mood; if palpitations are very uncomfortable, metoprolol can be used; digoxin is for atrial fibrillation or heart failure and is not routinely used for simple ectopy.\n\nPatient:\nPlease issue me a prescription, Doctor Chen; the Good Doctor platform requires a physician’s prescription to purchase medication.\n\nPatient:\nPlease issue a prescription, okay? The Good Doctor platform requires a physician’s prescription to purchase medication.\n\nPatient:\nI just bought metoprolol; is this the right drug for me? 25 mg, one and a half tablets per day, once daily, is that correct? How long should this medication be taken? Should it be taken only when uncomfortable, or should I stop when not uncomfortable?\n\nPatient:\nRegarding the heart after ten years post–fontan, ST changes, first-degree AV block—are there any precautions for taking metoprolol? Thank you. I plan to start with a half tablet, i.e., 12.5 mg, every other day on an empty stomach.\n\nDoctor:\nThe main concern is the heart rate; keep it at or above 60 beats per minute.",

Today marks the third day of taking the medication; she just completed another UV exposure, after which the swelling worsened, with discomfort and other symptoms.\nHope for help:\nWhether it can be cured, how to control the condition, what treatment is needed\nPregnancy status:\nNot pregnant\nDuration of illness:\nWithin one week\nHospital and department previously visited:\nLeting County Hospital, Endocrinology\nMedications:\nLevothyroxine tablets, 至灵菌丝胶囊\nAllergic history:\nNone (documented 2020-02-03)\nPast medical history:\nNone (documented 2020-02-03)\n\nDialogue\nDoctor:\nThank you for your trust. I have carefully read the medical information. Based on your current data, I suggest:\nHello, have you recently undergone related tests, or any neck discomfort?\nIf hypothyroidism is confirmed, continue treatment with levothyroxine and regularly recheck thyroid function, adjusting the drug dose according to the results.\nFrom the thyroid function report, the hypothyroidism appears to be quite severe, so oral levothyroxine therapy is indicated.\nThe thyroid enlargement is palpable, which is quite normal. Levothyroxine only improves thyroid function and will not eliminate the enlargement or nodules.\nThere may be acute or long treatment courses, and regular thyroid function rechecks with timely dose adjustments are necessary. Your thyroid function fluctuates quite a bit, which is likely related to pregnancy.\nLooking at the last report, this may be due to the increased demands after pregnancy; the body’s needs increase, so this kind of compensatory thyroid function occurred.\nWould this be easier to treat then?\nHypothyroidism, regardless of the underlying thyroid disease, generally requires a long treatment course, but normalizing thyroid function is achievable.\nYes.\nWhether there is any relation to UV irradiation is hard to say, as there is currently no clear evidence that UV exposure causes thyroid dysfunction.\nIf so, temporarily forgo UV exposure and observe.\nYou could try reducing the irradiation dose a bit.\nIt can be cured, but the time course is relatively long.\nYes, it needs to be taken for a period of time.\nAvoid spicy and irritating foods, and iodine-rich foods such as seaweed and kelp should not be eaten in excess.\nWhat I mean is to avoid iodine-containing foods.\n\nPatient:\nThese are the test results from the 23rd.\nAt the time, the thyroid swelling prompted the check.\nNow on the fourth day of taking Levothyroxine, the swelling has reduced but a lump is still palpable.\nCan hypothyroidism present acutely?\nDuring pregnancy, my tests did not reveal such problems.\nThese are the pregnancy check photos; now three months postpartum.\nWill it be easier to cure?\nI have vitiligo, and postpartum I started face and neck UVB phototherapy. Do you think my hypothyroidism could be related to this as well?\nOriginally I felt much better after taking the medicine for two days, but yesterday after light exposure the symptoms worsened again and I felt unwell.\nWell, I’m eager to improve the facial condition during maternity leave, and the UV dose was a bit high; after exposure my skin reddened, inflamed, and blistered. I’m not sure if this is related.\nOkay.\nDoctor, could this be cured?\nDo I need long-term medication?\nOkay.\nI’d also like to ask what I should pay attention to in my diet.\nSo iodine-containing foods should be avoided, right?\n\nDiagnosis and suggestions\nClinical summary and initial impression:\nHypothyroidism\nSummary and recommendations:\nOral levothyroxine therapy, recheck thyroid function in 2-3 weeks, adjust the medication dose according to results, avoid spicy/irritating foods, and do not overconsume iodine-containing foods.",

Advised to return to local hospital for continued infection prevention, rest, improved nutrition, increased ambulation, incision hygiene, avoid scratching; soft diet, avoid spicy foods, abstain from sexual activity and heavy labor for three months; return in four days for stitch removal; one month for follow-up; tubal iodine oil cholerangiography may be performed two months postoperatively; follow-up as needed.\nRecord by:\n\n2010-11-01 09:00 Physician group rounds\nPatient Liu Xianglan, female, 30, married, admitted because of “amenorrhea for more than two months and irregular vaginal bleeding for half a month.” After review of history and examinations by the physicians, left ectopic pregnancy was judged to be clear; differential with corpus luteum rupture and incomplete abortion noted; plan to complete related examinations and prepare for surgery; patient and family informed of possible infertility and other complications and anesthesia risks; family understood and consented.\n\nRecord by:\n\n2010-11-03 Postoperative Day 2\nThe patient reports incision pain; no headache or dizziness; rectum has not yet passed gas; urination normal; exam: Temperature 37.0°C; Pulse 84/min, Respirations 18/min, BP 110/70 mmHg; clear mental status; heart and lungs without abnormal findings; abdominal incision dressing dry with no discharge; vaginal bleeding minimal. The patient is allowed to mobilize appropriately; clear liquids tolerated; continue infection prevention and supportive care.\n\nRecord by:\n\n2010-11-01 18:00 Postoperative record\nToday at 15:00 the patient underwent left ectopic pregnancy removal under spinal-epidural anesthesia; midline abdominal incision removed, approximately 10 cm; sequential abdominal wall incision, opened peritoneal cavity. Found small amount of black clots in the rectouterine pouch; clots removed and washed with saline; uterus and right adnexa normal; left fallopian tube adhered to the hilum up to the fimbrial end with broad ligament involvement; local mild edema; carefully separated the left tube to the fimbrial end, found a 2×3 cm mass near the fimbrial end, soft, well-defined. The fimbrial end further separated; small amount of dark bleeding seen; saline irrigation and gauze cleaned; no active bleeding locally. Due to heavy adhesion of the left tube, conservative preservation not feasible; from the infundibulum to the far end, entire left tube were excised. Meticulous hemostasis and closure of separated peritoneum; counted instruments; closed abdomen layer by layer. Intraoperative anesthesia satisfactory; operation smooth; estimated blood loss about 100 mL; postoperative stable in the ward. Postoperative diagnoses: 1) Left tubal pregnancy with abortion 2) Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease.\nRecord by:\n\n2010-11-01 12:30 Anesthesiologist ward rounds\nPatient’s vital signs stable; alert and oriented; no fever or cough; normal bowel and bladder functions; cardiovascular and pulmonary exam without abnormal findings; related auxiliary examinations without abnormal findings; spine without deformity; suitable for spinal-epidural anesthesia.\nRecord by:",

Several values are mildly abnormal or at the edge of normal limits and merit periodic monitoring or follow-up testing.\n- Notable abnormalities include mildly elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) with a low AST/ALT ratio, mildly high total protein, slightly elevated Oddi sphincter basal pressure, evidence of some renal function parameter changes, low cystatin C, and several physiological indices suggesting minor deviations in liver and renal blood flow metrics and gas exchange indicators. Some lung function measures are below the lower limits of the reference range, particularly vital capacity and gas exchange surface area.\n- The rest of the endocrine, lipid, and immune markers are largely within expected ranges.\n\nKey abnormal values (highlights)\n- Total protein: **81.96 g/L**\n- ALT enzyme (mmol/L): **0.76**\n- AST enzyme (mmol/L): **0.54**\n- AST/ALT ratio: **0.71**\n- Venous CO₂ content (%): **62.43**\n- Gas exchange surface area (m²): **3447.00**\n- Vital capacity (cm³): **3145.49**\n- CK-MB: **35.03**\n- Functional residual capacity or related measures (e.g., CK-MB indexed values) are borderline\n- Oddi sphincter basal pressure: **44.14**\n- Creatinine: **48.18**\n- Glomerular filtration rate: **174.0**\n- Creatinine clearance: **169.0**\n- Cystatin C: **0.53**\n- Renal blood flow percentage: **27.89**\n- Renal blood flow ml/min: **1848.09**\n- SH: **5.82**\n- Venous CO₂ content: **62.43** (already noted)\n- Vascular permeability: **3.955**\n- Cell proliferation regulator: **4.3073**\n- MCH: **32**\n\nHealth recommendations\n- Liver-related findings:\n  - Mild elevations in ALT/AST and a lower AST/ALT ratio may reflect transient hepatic stress or metabolic load. Consider repeating liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin, GGT) in 4–8 weeks, along with a review of medications, alcohol use, and hepatotoxic exposures. Maintain a liver-friendly diet (balanced fat intake, adequate fiber, lean protein), limit alcohol, and stay hydrated.\n  - If elevations persist or worsen, consult a clinician for a targeted hepatic evaluation and potential imaging or serology as indicated.\n\n- Kidney and renal blood flow concerns:\n  - Creatinine is low and GFR/creatinine clearance are elevated; while this can occur with measurement variation or high muscle mass, consider repeating renal function tests and cystatin C if clinically indicated, and review nephrotoxic medication use. Ensure adequate hydration and monitor blood pressure.\n\n- Gas exchange and pulmonary function:\n  - Vital capacity and gas exchange surface area are below reference limits. If you have breathlessness, exercise intolerance, or wheeze, consider repeating pulmonary function tests and discussing with a respiratory specialist. Regular aerobic exercise, weight management, and avoiding environmental pollutants can help.\n\n- Biliary and pancreatic/duodenal indicators:\n  - Oddi sphincter basal pressure is mildly elevated. If there are biliary-type pains (biliary colic, RUQ discomfort, postprandial symptoms), pursue further evaluation with a hepatobiliary specialist.\n\n- Endocrine and glucose metabolism:\n  - SH 5.82 is below the reference range; fasting glucose is at the high end of normal (6.14 mmol/L). Maintain or adopt a balanced diet focusing on low-glycemic-index carbohydrates, regular physical activity, and weight control. Consider repeat fasting glucose and HbA1c testing if risk factors for metabolic syndrome exist.\n\n- Hematology indices:\n  - A few CBC indices show slight deviations (e.g., MCH 32, MCHC 360 at the upper limit). If there are symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, or pale skin, consider a follow-up CBC and iron studies as indicated.\n\n- Vascular and immune markers:\n  - Some immune activity and vascular permeability markers are outside the reference ranges. If you have unusual infections, inflammatory symptoms, or immune concerns, discuss with a clinician about targeted immunological assessment.\n\n- General lifestyle guidance:\n  - Maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle: regular aerobic exercise (at least 150 minutes per week), resistance training 2–3 days per week, and a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats.\n  - Avoid smoking and limit alcohol intake.\n  - Ensure adequate sleep and stress management.\n  - Keep regular health checkups and monitor any new symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, jaundice, dark urine, persistent abdominal pain).\n\nIf you would like, I can tailor a more detailed plan based on your medical history, symptoms, and risk factors, and help you prepare questions for your next clinician visit.",

      "sanswer": "体检结果及健康建议\n一 、血压降低\n1、正常状态下成人舒张压低于60mmHg或收缩压低于90mmHg或二者同时存在时为低血压。\n2、体检发现您有低血压 ，请您先复查血压 ，进一步明确有无低血压持续存在 ，若仍低 ，请到医院专科 诊治。\n二 、双眼屈光不正\n是指平行光线通过眼的屈光作用后 ，不能在视网膜上结成清晰的物像 。包括远视、近视及散光等 。建议 定期去医院检查视力 。平时注意用眼卫生 ，采取正确的看书、写字的姿势 ，避免眼睛过度疲劳。\n三 、 白带清洁度Ⅲ度\n1、 白带清洁度是以阴道内阴道杆菌、上皮细胞、 白细胞（或脓细胞）和杂菌的多少来分度的 。清洁度 Ⅰ-Ⅱ度为正常；Ⅲ-Ⅳ度为异常 ，大多可能为阴道炎 ，在卵巢功能不足 ，雌激素减低时 ， 易感染杂菌， 也可使清洁度变差。\n2、若有局部不适或白带发黄 ，异味等请到妇科诊治 。注意外阴清洁 ，勤换内裤 ，不穿化纤紧身裤。\n四 、 甲状腺双侧叶囊性结节 ， TI-RADS 2类\n甲状腺囊性结节一般都是良性 ，可以暂观察 。建议完善甲状腺功能测定检查 ，每年随访甲状腺超声 ，必 要时到医院甲状腺外科/普外科进一步检查诊治。\n五 、左侧乳腺低回声结节 ， BI-RADS 3类\n乳腺结节是一种症状 ，常见于乳腺良性肿瘤（如乳腺纤维瘤、分叶状肿瘤等） 以及乳腺恶性肿瘤（乳腺 癌） 。乳腺结节的成因尚不明确 ，与内分泌激素水平、基因突变及环境因素相关 。您本次体检超声提示 左侧乳腺低回声结节 ，BI-RADS 3类 ，建议半年后复查乳腺超声 ，主要观察肿块大小及形态学变化。\n六 、左侧乳腺囊性结节 ， BI-RADS 2类\n1、系体内女性激素（雌、孕激素）代谢障碍 ，使乳腺增生后复旧不全 ， 引起乳腺组织增生 。临床表现 为周期性胀痛（可与月经周期有关） 。多与内分泌不稳定及情绪压抑或工作压力过大有关。\n2、建议到医院乳腺专科诊治和随访。\n3、保持心情愉快 ，善于疏泄不良情绪 ，避免精神过度紧张 。注意膳食平衡 ，减少脂肪摄入量 ， 多吃蔬 菜与水果 。慎用化妆品和含雌激素的药物。\n七 、肝内钙化灶\n1、肝内钙化灶指在超声或CT图像上肝脏内出现强回声或高密度影像 。形成肝内钙化灶的病因很多， 如 ：肝内胆管结石、肝内慢性炎症、寄生虫感染、肝脏良恶性肿瘤和肝内转移瘤钙化等。\n2、必要时到医院肝胆外科进一步明确病因。\n八 、右肾尿盐结晶\n肾脏尿盐结晶可以不出现症状 ，建议平时多饮水 ，尤其是运动后及时补充液体 ， 以防止尿液浓缩形成尿 盐结晶 ，久之将会导致肾结石 。定期复查 ，若有腰痛、血尿等表现 ，请到泌尿外科诊治。\n九 、碳14呼气试验阳性\n1、碳14呼气试验阳性提示幽门螺旋杆菌感染 ，是慢性胃炎、 胃溃疡、 胃癌的诱因之一。\n2、若有腹胀、腹痛、嗳气等症状 ，建议到消化科进一步检查诊治。\n3、建议分餐制 ， 以预防消化道传染。\n十 、双肺叶散在少许微小实性密度结节影 ， 多系炎性结节\n1、肺结节病灶是指直径≤30mm的局灶性类圆形影 ， 以5～20mm直径的病灶较多见 ，单发结节应注意与 血管、肋骨端影鉴别 。病因常见于炎症、结核、肿瘤等 ，但90%以上的肺结节均为良性。\n2、请到医院呼吸内科咨询 ，结合临床进行鉴别诊断分析 。建议定期复查随访。\n十 一 、高密度脂蛋白胆固醇增高\n1、高密度脂蛋白是一种将血管内的脂类物质转运到血管外的载脂蛋白 ，被称为心脏的保护因子。\n2、此项增高对机体有保护作用 ，对于防止动脉硬化、预防心脑血管病的发生有重要作用。\n十二 、全血中切粘度降低\n1、可见于贫血、出血性疾病、肝硬化等 ， 需结合临床进行综合评估。\n2、偶尔一次全血粘度轻度降低 ，不一定有临床意义 ，建议定期复查。\n十三 、血小板分布宽度 、平均血小板体积增高\n目前无重要临床意义 ，可暂不干预。",

clinicians. It preserves terms and structure, and highlights key results and implications. If any item needs clarifying, especially where visit notes or local reference ranges differ, please consult the treating physician.\n\nHealth recommendations (based on the above results)\n\n- Blood pressure: Systolic BP 86 mmHg and Diastolic BP 51 mmHg are below normal. Consider repeating measurements on different days, ensure adequate hydration, and avoid sudden position changes. If symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, or fatigue occur, discuss with your clinician to assess for orthostatic causes or other etiologies.\n\n- Cardiovascular and metabolic health: HDL-C of 1.77 mmol/L is above the typical reference range, which is generally favorable, but keep a heart-healthy lifestyle (regular aerobic activity, balanced fats, weight maintenance). Other lipid parameters are normal. Fasting glucose is normal. Maintain a balanced diet and physical activity to support cardiovascular risk health.\n\n- Complete blood count: PDW and MPV are mildly elevated. Together with a normal CBC profile, this may be incidental; if symptoms such as abnormal bleeding or bruising occur, or if platelets trend up further, follow up with hematology.\n\n- Helicobacter pylori status: Positive C-14 urea breath test (C-value 88). This suggests H. pylori infection. Discuss eradication therapy options with your clinician, as appropriate guidelines recommend first-line eradication in confirmed infection.\n\n- Abdominal ultrasound: Intrahepatic calcifications and right kidney urinary salt crystals were observed. Consider correlation with liver and kidney history, metabolic status, and hydration. If there are symptoms (pain, dyspepsia, urinary symptoms), follow up with imaging or urology/hepatology as indicated.\n\n- Chest imaging: Chest CT shows scattered tiny nodules and multiple inflammatory nodules; correlate clinically. If symptoms such as cough, weight loss, fever persist or worsen, schedule follow-up imaging and clinical evaluation.\n\n- Thoracic and thyroid/adnexal findings: TI-RADS 2 thyroid nodules indicate benign lesions; BI-RADS 2 left breast cyst and BI-RADS 3 left breast nodule suggest benign or probably benign findings with short-interval follow-up recommended. Continue routine surveillance per local guidelines.\n\n- Gynecologic findings: History of cesarean section; no current acute gynecologic abnormalities noted. The TCT result NILM is reassuring; continue routine cervical cancer screening per guidelines.\n\n- HPV typing: All tested HPV types are negative or within normal range; no evidence of high-risk HPV types detected in the panel evaluated.\n\n- 12-lead ECG: Sinus rhythm with a normal tracing; no acute cardiac abnormalities detected at this time.\n\n- Bone density and arteriosclerosis assessments: Results indicate follow-up with the respective clinicians for interpretation and management plans.\n\n- Other tumor markers and organ function tests: All listed markers are within normal limits; no malignant or inflammatory process evident from these tests.\n\nIf you would like, I can provide a concise, clinically actionable one-page summary with bolded key terms and a structured health guidance section tailored to your priorities and risk factors.",
      "answer_en": "Physical Examination Results and Health Advice\n\nI. Hypotension\n1. In a normal adult, diastolic blood pressure below 60 mmHg or systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg or both constitutes hypotension.\n2. The examination found that you have hypotension. Please recheck your blood pressure to further confirm whether hypotension persists. If it remains low, please seek diagnosis and treatment at a hospital specialty department.\n\nII. Refractive errors of both eyes\nIt refers to the condition where parallel light rays after ocular refraction cannot form a clear image on the retina. Includes hyperopia, myopia, and astigmatism, etc. Regular hospital eye examinations are recommended. In daily life, pay attention to eye hygiene, adopt correct reading and writing posture, and avoid excessive eye fatigue.\n\nIII. Vaginal discharge cleanliness grade III\n1. Vaginal discharge cleanliness is graded by the amounts of lactobacilli, epithelial cells, leukocytes (or pus cells), and mixed flora in the vagina. Cleanliness grades I–II are normal; III–IV are abnormal, most likely indicating vaginitis. Under ovarian dysfunction or low estrogen, infection with mixed flora is common and can worsen cleanliness.\n2. If there is local discomfort or vaginal discharge that is yellow, foul-smelling, etc., please consult gynecology for diagnosis and treatment. Maintain vulvar hygiene, change underwear frequently, and avoid wearing tight synthetic underwear.\n\nIV. Bilateral thyroid cystic nodules, TI-RADS 2\nThyroid cystic nodules are generally benign and can be observed temporarily. It is advised to perform comprehensive thyroid function testing, and to follow up with thyroid ultrasound annually. If necessary, seek further evaluation in the thyroid/foregut surgery or general surgery departments.\n\nV. Left breast hypoechoic nodule, BI-RADS 3\nBreast nodules are a common presentation, seen in benign breast tumors (such as fibroadenoma, lobulated tumors, etc.) as well as malignant breast tumors (breast cancer). The cause of breast nodules is not fully clear and is related to endocrine hormone levels, gene mutations, and environmental factors. Your ultrasound at this exam shows a left breast hypoechoic nodule, BI-RADS 3. A six-month follow-up breast ultrasound is advised to monitor the size and morphological changes of the lesion.\n\nVI. Left breast cystic nodule, BI-RADS 2\n1. This is due to metabolic disturbances of female hormones (estrogen, progestins) causing incomplete regression after proliferation, leading to breast tissue proliferation. Clinically presents as cyclic pain (may be related to the menstrual cycle). Often associated with endocrine instability and emotional suppression or high work stress.\n2. Recommend consultation with a breast specialty in a hospital and follow-up.\n3. Maintain a positive mood, vent negative emotions, and avoid excessive mental stress. Pay attention to dietary balance, reduce fat intake, eat more vegetables and fruits. Use cosmetics and estrogen-containing medications with caution.\n\nVII. Intrahepatic calcifications\n1. Intrahepatic calcifications refer to bright echoes or high-density images within the liver on ultrasound or CT. Causes are numerous, such as intrahepatic bile duct stones, chronic liver inflammation, parasitic infections, benign or malignant liver tumors, and calcified intrahepatic metastases.\n2. If necessary, proceed to hepatobiliary surgery to determine the etiology.\n\nVIII. Right kidney urinary salt crystals\nRenal urinary salt crystals can be asymptomatic. It is recommended to drink more water regularly, especially after exercise, to prevent urine concentration and formation of urinary salt crystals, which over time can lead to kidney stones. Regular follow-up; if there is back pain or hematuria, please seek urology.\n\nIX. Positive carbon-14 breath test\n1. A positive carbon-14 breath test suggests Helicobacter pylori infection, a contributing factor to chronic gastritis, gastric ulcers, and gastric cancer.\n2. If there are symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, belching, etc., please consult gastroenterology for further evaluation.\n3. Recommend a divided-meal regimen to prevent digestive tract infections.\n\nX. Slight scattered micro-solid density nodular shadows in both lungs, mostly inflammatory nodules\n1. Pulmonary nodules refer to focal, oval or circular shadows with diameter ≤30 mm; most commonly 5–20 mm. A solitary nodule should be differentiated from vessels and rib edge shadows. Causes include inflammatory processes, tuberculosis, tumors, etc., but over 90% of pulmonary nodules are benign.\n2. Please consult the department of respiratory medicine in a hospital, and perform differential diagnosis analysis in conjunction with clinical data. Regular follow-up is recommended.\n\nXI. Elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n1. High-density lipoprotein is a lipoprotein that transports lipids from within vessels to outside, and is known as a cardioprotective factor.\n2. This elevation has a protective effect and plays an important role in preventing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases.\n\nXII. Decreased whole blood viscosity\n1. Can be seen in anemia, hemorrhagic disorders, cirrhosis, etc.; requires integrated clinical assessment.\n2. An occasional mild decrease in whole blood viscosity may have no clinical significance; regular follow-up recommended.\n\nXIII. Increased platelet distribution width and mean platelet volume\nCurrently of no significant clinical significance; no intervention needed.",

Right breast without mass.\n- Thyroid ultrasound: Left lobe shows a cystic lesion; TI-RADS 2. Right lobe without focal lesion.\n- Liver and biliary system: Multiple hepatic cystic lesions; several anechoic nodules in the liver; gallbladder polyp-like lesion.\n- Lungs and pleura: Chest CT shows scattered small nodules, most likely inflammatory; mild chronic inflammation in the left upper lobe lingula; apical pleural thickening/adhesions.\n- Pancreas, spleen, kidneys: Pancreas and spleen normal; kidneys normal in size and morphology, no stones or masses; no biliary dilation.\n- Other: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality detected on chest imaging.\n\n## Laboratory and other findings\n- Hematology: Anemia with microcytosis and hypochromia (Hb 102 g/L; MCV 77.1 fL; MCH 23.8 pg); RDW elevated; platelets mildly elevated (375 ×10^9/L); eosinophilia (eosinophils 22.7%; absolute 0.97 ×10^9/L); neutrophils relatively low (1.79 ×10^9/L).\n- Biochemistry: Liver enzymes within normal limits; total protein 85.7 g/L with albumin 45 g/L and globulin 40.7 g/L; A/G ratio 1.11 (slightly low); lipid panel largely normal (TC 4.46 mmol/L, TG 0.68 mmol/L, HDL 2.17 mmol/L, LDL 2.25 mmol/L); TT3 1.39 nmol/L; TSH 0.99 mIU/L; Free T4 17.6 pmol/L; Free T3 4.07 pmol/L; thyroid antibodies normal.\n- Renal function: Creatinine 54 µmol/L; Urea 4.50 mmol/L; eGFR 108.3 mL/min/1.73 m².\n- Urinalysis: Mostly normal; trace red blood cells; minor bacteria; no proteinuria.\n- Cardiac and other systems: ECG normal; no evident cardiac or pulmonary symptoms reported.\n\n# Health recommendations\n\n## Anemia evaluation and management\n- Obtain iron studies (serum iron, ferritin, TIBC) and reticulocyte count to characterize the microcytic anemia.\n- If iron deficiency is confirmed, initiate iron supplementation and investigate potential sources such as menstrual blood loss; consider GI evaluation if indicated.\n- Reassess CBC after iron therapy and monitor for symptomatic improvement.\n\n## Imaging follow-up and risk assessment\n- Left breast BI-RADS 3 lesion: schedule short-interval follow-up imaging in 6–12 months to document stability; if lesion grows or changes characteristics, pursue further evaluation (e.g., biopsy).\n- Thyroid left-lobe cystic lesion (TI-RADS 2): generally benign; continue routine ultrasound surveillance as advised by endocrinology.\n- Gallbladder polyp-like lesion: arrange follow-up ultrasound to monitor size; if polyp enlarges beyond a threshold (commonly around 6 mm) or symptoms develop, refer to hepatobiliary surgery for further assessment.\n- Hepatic cysts and right-lobe hypodense area: monitor with periodic imaging; if there are changes or persistent concerns, consider contrast-enhanced CT or MRI for further evaluation.\n- Lungs: small inflammatory nodules and mild chronic changes likely benign; correlate with clinical symptoms and consider follow-up imaging if respiratory symptoms develop or if there is interval change on future imaging.\n\n## Eosinophilia and allergies\n- If eosinophilia persists or there are clinical concerns (e.g., allergic disease or parasitic infection), pursue targeted history/testing and repeat CBC.\n\n## Nutritional status and lifestyle\n- Given underweight status (BMI 17.9), refer to a dietitian for nutritional assessment and plan to achieve a healthier weight through balanced caloric and protein intake.\n- Encourage regular physical activity as tolerated and monitor weight and appetite.\n\n## General follow-up\n- Continue routine primary care follow-up for ongoing assessment of imaging findings, anemia, and metabolic measures; discuss results with your healthcare provider to tailor further investigations or interventions as needed.",
      "answer_en": "### Conclusions and Health Advice\n\n1. **Underweight**  \nPlease increase nutritional intake and ensure adequate rest.\n\n2. **Eosinophilia**  \nThis condition can occur in allergic diseases, parasitic infections, hematologic diseases, etc. Correlate with clinical symptoms and schedule regular follow-up examinations.\n\n3. **Low hemoglobin**  \nRecommend rechecking. If the repeat test remains low, consider anemia, and you should go to the hematology department for further investigation and treatment.\n\n4. **Elevated platelet count**  \nOutpatient follow-up and reexamination are required. If the platelet count continues to rise, consult an internal medicine physician.  \n- Platelet count is a main test for diagnosing bleeding disorders and hematologic diseases.  \n- Its elevation can occur in acute massive bleeding and post-hemolytic reactive thrombocytosis, myeloproliferative disorders, malignancies, infections, hypoxia, trauma, splenectomy, etc., and may also be due to hemoconcentration (e.g., dehydration).\n\n5. **Cystic lesion in the left thyroid lobe (TI-RADS grade 2)**  \nThis type of lesion is common in young women, usually solitary, though multifocal cases exist, generally confined to one side of the gland. It is firm in texture with clear, smooth margins, may move with swallowing; ultrasound may show an anechoic fluid-filled area. It is recommended to consult a general surgery specialist and to have regular follow-up.\n\n6. **Left breast hypoechoic nodule (BI-RADS category 3)**  \nThis nodule may be due to a cyst or fibrosis of inflammatory lesions. It is recommended to perform breast ultrasound or mammography for further diagnosis; if necessary, surgical biopsy may be required to confirm.\n\n7. **Hepatic cystic lesion**  \n- Hepatic cysts are common benign liver lesions, consisting of benign fluid-filled sacs, which can be solitary or multiple. Most are congenital, usually asymptomatic, and do not affect liver function.  \n- Sometimes cysts enlarge with age; if the diameter exceeds 5 cm, seek evaluation by hepatobiliary surgery. Please regularly follow up with liver ultrasound.\n\n8. **Gallbladder polypoid lesion**  \nThese are protrusions into the gallbladder lumen from the gallbladder wall, usually round or hemispherical, and may be solitary or multiple. Smaller polyps can be observed with regular follow-up; if polyps are larger than 1 cm or multiple, surgical treatment is appropriate to prevent malignant transformation. Please regularly follow up with hepatobiliary ultrasound; if necessary, consult hepatobiliary surgery.\n\n9. **Both lungs**  \n- Multiple scattered nodules in both lungs are mostly inflammatory; compared with the old film dated 2023-03-24, changes are not significant; please follow up regularly.  \n- Mild chronic inflammation in the lingular segment of the left upper lobe.  \n- Pleural thickening and adhesions at the lung apices.  \n- The lung markings are mainly formed by the pulmonary arteries; on X-ray they appear as branching, tree-like shadows radiating from the hila to the lung fields, tapering from thick to thin and fading in the peripheral areas. When lung markings become more numerous or thicker, X-ray findings include increased density, thickening, distorted course, and abnormal morphology, which can be seen in various cardiopulmonary or connective tissue diseases. Must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical history; generally, after excluding heart disease, most are bronchial in origin. It is recommended to evaluate with clinical symptoms and consult a pulmonologist, with regular follow-up and surveillance.\n\n10. **CT scan shows a slightly hypodense area in the right lobe of the liver**  \nPlease correlate with clinical findings; if necessary, perform contrast-enhanced CT or MRI for further evaluation, and follow up with the hepatobiliary surgery department.\n\nOther elevated or decreased indices have no clinical significance currently; regular follow-up is recommended. If you experience discomfort, please seek specialized medical care promptly.",

Recommend further tests, such as abdominal ultrasound and hepatitis virus markers, to rule out hepatobiliary disease.\n\n#### 4. Thyroid Ultrasound Examination\n- **Bilateral multinodular thyroid with calcification in the right lobe**\n- **Recommendations**: Thyroid nodules with calcification require further assessment, such as thyroid function tests and fine-needle aspiration biopsy to exclude malignant tumor. Regular recheck of thyroid ultrasound to monitor nodular changes.\n\n#### 5. Right Kidney Ultrasound\n- **Right renal calculus with mild hydronephrosis**\n- **Recommendations**: Right kidney stones may cause hydronephrosis. Recommend further tests, such as urinalysis and renal function tests, to rule out renal function impairment. Encourage increased fluid intake to raise urine output and promote stone passage. If pain occurs, seek medical care promptly.\n\n#### 6. Oral Examination\n- **Chronic periodontitis with gingival recession**\n- **Recommendations**: Chronic periodontitis requires regular dental cleanings, plaque control, and prevention of further inflammation. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush, proper brushing technique, and daily flossing. If periodontal inflammation worsens, seek medical care.\n- **Caries**\n- **Recommendations**: Caries require timely treatment to prevent progression to pulpitis. Schedule regular dental checkups and promptly fill caries. Maintain good oral hygiene and reduce sugar intake.\n- **Dentin hypersensitivity**\n- **Recommendations**: Dentin hypersensitivity can be alleviated by using fluoride toothpaste, reducing thermal stimuli, and avoiding acidic foods. If severe sensitivity persists, seek medical care and use professional desensitizing products.\n- **Mild oral mucosal lesion (lip mucosa desquamation)**\n- **Recommendations**: Lip mucosa desquamation may be related to dryness or dehydration. Recommend drinking more water, increasing indoor humidity, and using lip balm. If discomfort persists, seek medical advice.\n\n### Summary\nThere are multiple abnormal findings in your physical examination report. It is recommended that you pursue further investigations and treatment based on the above suggestions.

About 8–9 months ago a hard, non-mobile, egg-sized mass was felt in the lower abdomen midline. 8–9 months later, menstrual flow markedly increased; in the past 3 months she has frequently leaked through pads and clothing due to leakage; menses extended to 8–9 days while cycle remained unchanged. One year ago she underwent evaluation at Tai’an xx Hospital and was diagnosed with a uterine fibroid about fist-sized, recommending surgical treatment, which was declined because she has been married for 7 years without conception. About 1 month ago the mass enlarged rapidly, vaginal irregular bleeding, dull lower abdominal pain. General fatigue and dizziness present. One week ago a pelvic examination showed the abdominal mass enlarged to the size of about a 5-month pregnancy uterus. Outpatient diagnosis at that time was “uterine fibroid malignant transformation, secondary anemia,” and she was admitted.\n\nPast Medical History\nGenerally good health; no hemorrhagic disease or anemia history. Had measles at age 3 and varicella at age 5. Vaccination history not known. No trauma or prior surgery; no history of transfusion or drug allergy.

Chest pain followed, described as stabbing like being pierced; coughing or deep breathing aggravated the pain. He did not seek treatment and went directly to the outpatient department, where he was admitted. Outpatient diagnosis was bronchiectasis with infection and costochondritis. Throughout the illness, energy and appetite were good, bowel and bladder normal. In the past 2 years, exercise tolerance gradually worsened; climbing stairs or performing work with slight exertion induced severe dyspnea, but improvement occurred with rest.\n\n## Past Medical History\nKnown bronchiectasis.

Three years ago, without obvious cause, she began to suspect that neighbors were talking badly about her; whenever she saw neighbors she felt ill intent. This gradually developed into suspicion that neighbors intended to harm her, to poison her food, and later that neighbors’ family and unit colleagues all wanted to harm her. She felt anxious and believed others spoke about her conduct, slandering her everywhere and even spreading it to her face. She became fearful of being poisoned and harmed by others, and two years ago spontaneously requested medical leave and stayed at home. Twenty-five days ago, her persecutory delusions intensified: she suspected a neighbor had installed a listening device in her home and was constantly monitoring her behavior; she also heard that the neighbor was spreading her private information publicly, fabricating rumors to harm her and to incite trouble between her and her husband, and that monitoring of her behavior was being reported to the police, who would come to arrest her. The patient is in a state of fright and fears the police might implant a device in her brain to alter her thoughts and actions. The family observed abnormal behavior and language and brought her to this hospital.\n\nPast Medical History\nBefore this illness, the patient was in good health. She denies major physical illnesses, including hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease; denies infectious diseases such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, or bacterial dysentery; denies major trauma or surgery; denies transfusion history; denies drug or food allergies and poisoning history; vaccination status per local guidelines. No convulsions, coma, or convulsive episodes. Birthplace and early life history: first pregnancy; mother healthy during pregnancy; no infection or radiation exposure; no medications during pregnancy; normal delivery; full-term, eutrophic; breastfed after birth; normal early growth and development; attained school-age education with average-to-better performance. At age 18, she completed secondary vocational education and was assigned to work in Qingdao; no history of long-term residence elsewhere; has worked as an accountant at her unit and could undertake the work. Before illness, she was introverted and had average social interaction. Denies tobacco, alcohol, or other unhealthy habits; denies history of exposure to endemic local diseases or unprotected sexual activity; denies exposure to toxins or use of psychoactive substances. Menstrual history: 15th day; (garbled/unclear data). For 2011-04-15, menstruation volume and color were normal; no dysmenorrhea; normal vaginal discharge; married at age 27; has one child; obstetric history: Gravida 1, Para 0, Abortions 0, Living 1.

General Presentation\nThe patient walked into the ward by herself, with steady gait. She was oriented to self, environment, time, place, and people. Clothing and appearance matched age; was tidy, engaged with others, and could adapt to the ward environment; no evident paranoia or hostility. Sleep was adequate at night; self-care intact; appetite good; bowel and bladder functions normal.\n\n2. Cognitive Function\n(1) Perception: True auditory hallucinations for over 20 days; commentary-type voices; clear voices; patient does not doubt them. No accompanying illusion or perceptual integration impairment.\n- When asked about her recent condition: “About 20 days ago, at about 3 a.m., I heard several people outside the window discussing me, saying I had bad conduct, that I used to be a prostitute; another said “report to the police quickly, don’t let her harm people here.”” (Response: flat)\n- Asked if the voices were familiar: “No, they are all strangers.”\n- Asked what she did at the time: “I listened for a while, then went out to look, and found that the voices were coming from the TV antenna, and that they had installed a listening device in my home.” (Response: flat)\n- Asked what happened next: “Then I heard people in the police station talking daily, and they intend to arrest me.” (Response: flat)\n- Can her husband hear the voices? “He can’t hear them; he says I am hallucinating.”\n- Do images distort? “No.”\n(2) Thought process: Thought process is coherent and fluently spoken; persecutory delusions present with content involving poisoning, insult, eavesdropping, surveillance; delusional content largely secondary to auditory hallucinations; no impairment in associative thinking, form, or reasoning; no grandiose ideas.\n- Asked why those people persecuted her: “Now I recall there was conflict with neighbor Li **; she kept getting back at me and tried to poison my food, causing chronic poisoning.” (Flat)\n- Is family aware of these things? “My husband and brother are evasive and sometimes also place nitrates in my meals to use me as their mouthpiece; I had seen through it.” (Flat)\n- Any irresistible preoccupation? “No.”\n(3) Memory: Remote, recent, and immediate memory are intact.\n- What year did you come to Qingdao to work? “1971.”\n- Who brought you today? “My brother.”\n- Digit span: “61730.” Answer: “61730.”\n(4) Intelligence: General knowledge, calculation, analysis, abstraction, and comprehension are adequate; intelligence normal.\n- 92 − 38 = ?\n- “54.”\n- What is the difference between a chicken and a duck?\n- “Beak and feet differ.”\n- Who is the President of the United States?\n- “Obama.”\n(5) Attention: During conversation, attention was sustained; no slowing, no fixity, no stimulus-bound attention, and no narrowing of attention.\n(6) Insight: Absence of insight.\n- Do you think you are ill?\n- “Not ill. But living here is safe; if there were poison in my food, it would be detected; I am willing to stay.”\n\n3. Affective Experience\nAlthough the patient feels persecuted, she lacks appropriate emotional responses and presents a flat affect. Affective state and cognitive and volitional processes show a poor connection.\n\n4. Volition and Behavior\nInterpersonal contact and activity are reduced; no enhancement or reduction of primitive urges; higher-level volition is diminished; unwilling to continue working; only asks “Don’t harm me,” with few other demands. No stupor, refusal behavior, grimacing, or persistent movements; no imitation, stereotyped, or compulsive actions; the link between volition, cognition, and affect is limited.\n\nAuxiliary Examinations\n\nDate of Examination: 2011-04-21\n- Head CT: [Hospital] ([location masked]); No abnormal findings.\n- SANS: In-hospital total score: **\n- SAPS: In-hospital total score: **\n- ECG: Within normal limits\n- Complete Blood Count: WBC 6.7 × 10^9/L\n\nPreliminary Diagnosis\nSchizophrenia, paranoid type\nLi **\n\nDate: 2011-04-21",

This gradually developed into the belief that the neighbors intended to persecute her, poison her food, and later that the neighbors’ family and coworkers at her workplace all wanted to harm her. This was accompanied by irritability, suspicion that others said she behaved improperly, and widespread malicious rumors about her, which she could hear directly. Relationships with neighbors and coworkers became tense. Fearing that others would poison her to death, she voluntarily retired from work and stayed at home two years ago. Twenty-five days ago, her sense of persecution intensified; she suspected a neighbor had installed a listening device in her home to monitor her every action, and she constantly heard the neighbor broadcasting her private information to the public, defaming her, and provoking conflicts with her husband. The neighbor reportedly expanded the monitored behavior and notified the police; the police were coming to arrest her.

young，MODY）是一类特殊类型糖尿病，于1975年首先被报道，通常起病年龄较轻，临床症状不重，有家族遗传史。1991年，Bell等在1个庞大的MODY家系中定位了20号染色体长臂的致病基因位点，命名为MODY1，为发现肝细胞核因子4α（hepatic nuclear factor 4α，HNF4A）基因为MODY1的致病基因奠定了基础。翌年，Froguel等发现了7号染色体短臂上的第2个MODY基因位点，并确认为葡萄糖激酶（glucokinase，GCK）基因，即MODY2。之后又确认了MODY1基因为HNF4A，并陆续确认了肝细胞核因子1α（hepatic nuclear factor 1α，HNF1A）、胰十二指肠同源盒因子（pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor‐1，PDX-1）基因等其他MODY基因，迄今已报道有14种MODY类型。\nMODY约占糖尿病患者人数的1%~5%，其中GCK和肝细胞核因子基因突变类型较为常见。MODY发病常常较为隐匿，临床上时常被漏诊，常在妊娠期糖尿病筛查中被发现。随着对MODY临床特点认识的深入以及分子生物学检测技术的迅速发展，越来越多的MODY患者被早期发现和诊断。为了规范MODY筛查新技术和新方法在临床的推广使用，中华医学会糖尿病学分会糖尿病基础研究与转化医学学组邀请国内糖尿病领域部分专家撰写本共识，旨在帮助MODY患者得以早期发现、正确诊断、精准治疗，推动MODY的规范化筛查与诊治。\n流行病学\nMODY是最常见的一类单基因突变型糖尿病，白种人和黄种人均有报道，MODY估计约占所有糖尿病患者的 1%~5%，欧洲地区 MODY 的人群患病率基本接近，估计为 68/100万~108/100万，美国MODY 患病率估计为 21/100万。然而，亚洲人群患病率目前尚不清楚。截至目前，MODY共发现有14 种基因突变类型，而在不同种族中，MODY 致病基因谱亦有明显差异。白种人HNF1A及GCK基因突变比率为70%~80%，而中国人、日本人的HNF1A及GCK突变比率仅为5%~10%。值得注意的是，由于MODY起病隐匿，发病初期很少出现明显代谢紊乱，后续进展缓慢，临床表现多样，临床症状与1 型糖尿病（type 1 diabetes mellitus，T1DM）及 2 型糖尿病（type 2 diabetes mellitus，T2DM）均有重叠，且部分患者无典型的家族聚集表现或家系调查困难 ，临 床 常 常 被 误 诊 为 T1DM 或 T2DM。 因 此 ，MODY的患病率可能被低估。\n临床特点\nMODY 包含了一系列表现为常染色体显性遗传的单基因糖尿病，典型的MODY往往有3代及以上的家族史、青年起病（25 岁前）、无 T1DM 相关的自身抗体、不需要胰岛素治疗且无酮症倾向。目前已鉴定出14个不同的 MODY 亚型，分别由14个不同的致病基因突变所致，其中的3个MODY亚型和其相关基因（B 淋巴细胞激酶、成对盒4和 Krüppel样转录因子11）的致病性尚存在争议（表1）。\n\nGCK、HNF1A 和 HNF4A 是常见的MODY致病基因 ，其次是肝细胞核因子1B（hepatic nuclear factor 1B，HNF1B），其余的致病基因都非常罕见。本共识主要介绍 4种常见MODY的临床特点。\n一、HNF4A‐MODY（MODY1）\n是由于编码肝细胞核因子4α蛋白的HNF4A基因突变所致。HNF4A 基因突变导致胰岛β细胞受葡萄糖刺激后分泌的胰岛素减少，且这种分泌缺陷随着时间的推移进行性加重。患者常常在青春期或儿童期已出现高血糖，虽然磺脲类药物治疗的初始效果良好，但随着时间的推移与胰岛素分泌缺陷的进展，患者最终往往需要胰岛素治疗。HNF4A‐MODY 患者因血糖控制不佳发生微血管病变的风险与普通T2DM类似。\nHNF4A‐MODY的临床特点如下：\n1.胎儿或新生儿存在过度胰岛素分泌，新生儿可出现一过性高胰岛素血症性低血糖，至少50%以上的患者出生时为巨大儿。\n2.患者以胰岛素分泌缺陷为主，一般没有明显的胰岛素抵抗。\n3.患者在起病早期对磺脲类药物较敏感，小剂量的磺脲类药物可维持良好的血糖控制。\n二、GCK‐MODY（MODY2）\n由于编码葡萄糖激酶的GCK基因突变所致。葡萄糖激酶主要功能是将葡萄糖磷酸化为葡萄糖‐6‐磷酸，并充当胰岛β细胞的葡萄糖感受器，该酶的缺陷会导致葡萄糖刺激胰岛素分泌的阈值升高。\nGCK‐MODY的临床特点如下：\n1.患者的高血糖通常稳定且轻微，主要表现为轻度空腹高血糖（5.7~8.3 mmol/L）和糖化血红蛋白（glycated hemoglobin A1c，HbA1c）轻度升高（5.7%~7.6%）。\n2.常规口服降糖药物治疗效果差。\n3. 患者患糖尿病大血管和微血管并发症的危险非常低。\n三、HNF1A‐MODY（MODY3）\n由于编码肝细胞核因子1α蛋白的HNF1A基因突变所致，是白种人中最常见的 MODY 亚型。HNF1A 蛋白是β细胞中胰岛素基因的弱反式激活因子，HNF1A 基因突变可导致胰岛素分泌异常。和 HNF4A‐MODY 类似，HNF1A‐MODY 患者没有明显的胰岛素抵抗，部分使用胰岛素治疗的患者在明确 HNF1A基因存在突变后成功转换为磺脲类药物单药治疗。患者的胰岛素分泌缺陷会随着病程逐渐加重 ，因此 最终往往需要胰岛素治疗。HNF1A‐MODY患者发生微血管病变比例较高。\nHNF1A‐MODY的临床特点如下：\n1. 由于 HNF1A蛋白调控肾小管上皮细胞中钠‐葡萄糖协同转运蛋白2（sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2，SGLT2）基因的表达，HNF1A 基因突变可导致肾糖阈降低，出现尿糖阳性，类似于临床上使用SGLT2抑制剂，在未发病的基因突变携带者中也可检测到葡萄糖负荷引起的糖尿。\n2.患者以胰岛素分泌缺陷为主，一般没有明显的胰岛素抵抗，常被误诊为T1DM。\n3.对磺脲类药物比较敏感，降糖效果优于二甲双胍，治疗T2DM的标准剂量磺脲类药物偶可诱发低血糖。\n4. 和其他类型糖尿病相比，超敏 C 反应蛋白（high sensitivity C‐reactive protein，hs‐CRP）水平更低。\n四、HNF1B‐MODY（MODY5）\n由于编码肝细胞核因子1β蛋白的 HNF1B 基因缺陷所致。特别值得注意的是，除了基因点突变以外，HNF1B基因的大片段缺失也十分常见，约占所有 HNF1B‐MODY 患者的一半，HNF1B 基因的大片段缺失通常是17q12缺失综合征的一部分。此外，HNF1B‐MODY患者中约有一半为新发突变，没有家族史。HNF1B‐MODY患者的临床表型十分丰富，包括早发糖尿病、胰腺萎缩、泌尿生殖系统发育异常、缓慢进展的肾功能不全、低镁血症等。其中，肾脏的发育和功能异常是 HNF1B‐MODY 的1个重要临床特征。与HNF1B基因点突变不同，HNF1B基因大片段缺失的患者还可合并出现神经、精神系统的异常。\nHNF1B‐MODY的临床特点如下：\n1.患者可表现为各种肾脏发育异常，其中肾囊肿十分常见，此外还可表现为孤立肾、马蹄肾、肾积水、肾小管功能障碍等。患者常常伴有缓慢进展的肾功能不全。\n2. 生殖系统畸形亦常见，男性患者可有隐睾、尿道下裂、附睾囊肿、输精管发育不全等。女性患者可表现为双角子宫、双子宫、子宫缺如、双阴道、阴道发育不全等。\n3.由于HNF1B 蛋白对于胰腺内外分泌腺的发育均十分重要，患者在发育阶段即存在β细胞数量不足，因此常在青春期或成年早期被确诊为糖尿病，且通常需要胰岛素治疗。\n4.影像学可表现为胰腺萎缩（部分胰腺组织缺如），同时合并胰腺外分泌腺功能障碍，粪便弹性蛋白酶减少。\n5. 患者常表现为低镁血症，同时合并低尿钙，个别患者还可合并出现甲状旁腺功能亢进。\n6.患者可有肝酶升高及胆汁淤积，可有高尿酸血症及痛风发作。\n7.大片段缺失的患者还可合并神经、精神系统异常，如自闭症、癫痫、认知障碍等。\nMODY筛查\n一、临床筛查\n根据MODY的定义，临床筛查应重点关注发病年龄<25岁、自身抗体阴性、胰岛功能尚存、不伴有代谢紊乱、同时父母中有一方受累的患者。随着对MODY各个亚型的深入研究，发现某些类型还具有一些额外的特征（表1）。因此，当临床上遇到的糖尿病患者存在以下特征时，需考虑到 MODY 的可能性。\n1.家族成员中有多人确诊糖尿病，并符合常染色体显性遗传学特征。\n2. 新生儿糖尿病或新生儿低血糖的个人史或家族史。\n3.早发糖尿病（起病年龄<35岁，<25岁时可能性更大）。\n4. 具有不同于 T1DM 的临床特点，即确诊时T1DM 相关自身抗体均阴性；治疗所需要的胰岛素剂量较小；诊断为“T1DM”3~5 年后仍能够产生胰岛 素（ 血 糖 >4 mmol/L 时 ，C 肽 >0.6 ng/ml 或200 pmol/L）；停用胰岛素不会发生酮症。\n5.具有不同于T2DM的临床特征，即45岁之前起病且体重指数（body mass index，BMI）及腰围正常或偏低；甘油三酯正常或偏低，高密度脂蛋白胆固醇正常或升高。\n6.轻度、持续的、无进展的空腹高血糖，常规降糖药物治疗效果不佳。\n7.对磺脲类药物过于敏感。\n8.影像学提示胰腺发育或形态学异常。\n9.具有胰腺以外的综合征样临床表现（如泌尿生殖系统发育异常、合并神经、精神系统异常等）。\n二、遗传筛查\n针对高度疑似MODY的患者，基因检测是明确诊断的金标准。由于 MODY 的致病基因没有突变热点，致病突变可能位于基因覆盖的编码区和非编码区，包括点突变、插入缺失突变和大片段结构变异等，其中编码区非同义突变和剪切体变异较常见。常见检测方法主要包括一代测序（Sanger）和二代测序（next generation sequencing，NGS）。其中NGS技术能够实现单次实验检测多个基因，大大提高了检测通量和效率，同时降低了成本，已广泛用于单基因遗传病的筛查。Sanger的准确性高、操作简单，但通量低、费用高、检测的区域和样本量受到限制，目前多用于 NGS 结果的验证和家系成员筛查。\n随着NGS的不断推广，尤其是靶向单基因糖尿病的测序产品逐渐成熟，MODY致病基因区域检测出的变异会越来越多，如何判定变异的性质变得尤为重要。目前国际较为通用的是2015年美国医学遗 传 学 和 基 因 组 学 学 院/分 子 病 理 学 协 会（American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology，ACMG/AMP）公布的《测序变异解读的标准和指南》，该指南通过公共人群数据库中的等位基因频率、疾病数据库和文献检索、软件预测、实验室功能检测和家系中变异与表型共分离等方面的证据把变异分为“致病性”“可能致病性”“意义不确定”“良性”和“可能良性”。值得注意的是，由于对疾病和基因功能理解的局限，目前对于临床高度怀疑MODY 的患者进行全外显子测序时，仍然有超过50% 的患者不能给出明确的分子诊断。在临床实践中变异性质判定必须慎重，错误的诊断对先证者及其家族成员都有潜在危害，因此在解读变异时需要专业的遗传咨询知识。\n筛查路径\nMODY相对罕见，亟须一个合理的筛查路径富集 MODY 疑似患者，以达到增加检测阳性率、减少漏诊率和减轻患者经济负担的目标。然而，由于MODY不同亚型之间的临床特征异质性很大，权衡诊断率、漏诊率和检测费用将是一个很大的挑战。\n英国的一项横断面研究结果显示，在发病年龄<30 岁、血清 C 肽>200 pmol/L 的 T2DM 患者中，HNF1A-MODY 和 HNF4A‐MODY发病率高达25%。我国学者在抗体阴性的临床诊断T1DM患者中（诊断年龄中位数20岁）发现MODY患者约占17%。法国的一项横断面研究发现，胰岛自身抗体阴性的患者中，同时至少满足以下3个条件中的2个，MODY检出率为16%；3个条件分别为：（1）发病年龄在15~40 岁或至少2个亲属患糖尿病 ；（2）BMI<30 kg/m2或至少2个亲属患糖尿病；（3）有至少2代糖尿病家族遗传史；筛选条件增加到 3 代及以上家族遗传史和 BMI<25 kg/m2的 40 岁前发病的高加索人群，检出率将提高到43%。这些研究提示，发病早、胰岛功能尚存、胰岛自身抗体阴性和连续的家族遗传史这些临床特征能够有效地富集MODY患者。当然，也会有相当比例的MODY患者由于新发突变致病而表现为没有家族遗传史。在临床实践中，根据具体情况可以适当放宽对于家族史的要求。\nGCK‐MODY的发病年龄跨度较大，并发症发生风险较低。由于对各种口服降糖药物均不敏感，控制饮食和增加运动应作为非妊娠患者的主要治疗手段；同时有报道显示，该亚型在中国糖尿病患者中 所 占的比例较高，因此有必要对疑似GCK‐MODY的患者进行明确的分子诊断，避免此类患者接受不必要的治疗。\n目前基因检测成本逐年下降，适当放宽筛选条件，能够提高诊断率、减少漏诊率，让更多的MODY患者有机会接受基因筛查。因此，建议在 BMI≤24 kg/m2、无代谢综合征和有 2代及以上家族史的糖尿病患者中，针对≤25 岁发病的患者，通过胰岛自身抗体和空腹 C 肽水平（fasting C‐peptide，FCP）筛选；25 岁<发病年龄≤45 岁发病的患者，T2DM 患者比例相对升高，增加为 3 代及以上家族遗传史（连续有血缘关系）和胰岛自身抗体进行筛选；对疑似 GCK‐MODY 的新诊断糖尿病患者，通过空腹血糖（fasting plasma glucose，FPG）为5.4~8.3 mmol/L或HbA1c为 5.8%~7.6%，口服降糖药物疗效不佳筛选，对符合筛选条件的糖尿病患者建议开展基因检测（图1）。\n\n图1 MODY的筛查策略与路径\n治疗\n明确 MODY 的亚型有助于选择适当的治疗方案，对其预后也有重要影响。MODY患者可以用胰岛素治疗，部分患者也可以通过口服降糖药物（如磺脲类药物）进行控制，选择合适的治疗方法有利于提高患者生活质量。\n一、生活方式干预\n生活方式干预为一线治疗。所有糖尿病患者均建议优先进行饮食干预，尤其在血糖和 HbA1c水平仍在“非糖尿病”范围内时，合理的策略是使用低碳水化合物、低热卡饮食，减少含糖饮料和果汁的摄入，增加低糖水果和蔬菜的摄入量，保持健康的生活方式。运动是糖尿病管理计划的重要组成部 分 ，建 议坚持每天进行 60 min 中等强度的运动。\n二、降糖药物\n治疗目标应是在 3~4 个月内将 FPG 水平控制在 7 mmol/L 以下，HbA1c水平控制在 6.5% 以下。大部分 MODY 患者口服药物治疗即可达到血糖控制目标，有些类型 MODY 患者，尤其病程较长的患者需要接受胰岛素治疗。部分类型 MODY 患者也可使用胰高糖素样肽‐1 受体激动剂（glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist，GLP‐1RA）。\n1.HNF4A‐MODY（MODY1）：MODY1 的儿童和青少年，控制饮食是一种合理的治疗方法。但随着时间的推移，大多数患者将经历 β 细胞功能恶化，需要使用药物治疗。MODY1患者对磺酰脲类药物敏感，且可以发挥胰腺外作用，如减少肝脏的葡萄糖输出和增强外周组织胰岛素敏感性，但需注意从小剂量起始以避免低血糖；也有 MODY1 患者使用二肽基肽酶 Ⅳ 抑制剂（dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors，DPP‐4i）能获得很好的降糖效果，同时避免低血糖的发生。\n2.GCK‐MODY（MODY2）：GCK‐MODY患者通常无症状，血糖轻度升高，尤其以FPG水平升高常见，餐后血糖变化不明显，微血管并发症少见，其分泌的胰岛素足够应对进食后血浆葡萄糖浓度的增加。因此，MODY2患者建议仅使用饮食干预，不推荐使用药物治疗，且口服降糖药或胰岛素治疗不会降低患者 HbA1c水平，但妊娠期建议使用胰岛素来防止胎儿过度生长，并建议给予高于标准剂量的胰岛素。关于启用胰岛素的时机，因胎儿GCK基因型而异，可以在妊娠合并血糖升高时立即开始启用，也可以仅在胎儿过度生长时使用，但均需密切监测胚胎宫内生长速度，及时调整治疗方案。对于亚洲人群，由于较多人群出现正常体重合并胰岛素抵抗，尤其对于高碳水化合物饮食和缺乏运动的MODY2患者建议使用口服药物治疗。\n3. HNF1A‐MODY（MODY3）：MODY3 是 所 有MODY 分型中最常见的 1 种，随着年龄的增大，胰岛素的分泌逐渐减少，并且血糖控制趋于恶化，发生微血管和大血管并发症的风险与T1DM和T2DM相似，因此需要进行积极治疗。MODY3 患者的治疗取决于年龄和 HbA1c水平 ，但很大程度上与MODY1 治疗选择类似。如果 HbA1c值<6.5%，则一线治疗应采用低糖的饮食，当饮食干预不能满足血糖控制时可使用磺脲类药物治疗。与MODY1类似，患者在使用磺脲类药物进行治疗时，治疗方案的第一目标是避免低血糖，因此，建议在成年人中初始剂量为有效量的 1/4，并在血糖控制的基础上逐步增加。但是长期使用磺脲类药物仍可能导致体重增加和内源性胰岛素分泌减少，最终部分患者可能进展为胰岛素依赖的T2DM。\n相反，GLP‐1RA 和 DPP‐4i 可降低血糖水平并增加内源性胰岛素水平。其主要原因在于这两类药物增加胰岛素分泌不是通过增加ATP生成，而是通过增加 cAMP 产生，从而克服了 MODY3 患者需要受损线粒体产生 ATP的过程。因此，GLP‐1受体激动剂和 DPP‐4i诱导的胰岛素分泌方式可能更有效地增加这些患者的胰岛素分泌 。 此外 ，GLP‐1RA和DPP‐4i在MODY3患者治疗中可减少β细胞凋亡，促进 β 细胞生成。临床研究也发现GLP‐1RA在MODY3治疗中能获得和磺脲类药物相当的降糖效果，且更低的低血糖发生率，在儿童MODY3 患者中的研究也有同样的发现，因此，GLP‐1RA 和 DPP‐4i 在 MODY3 患者中可能带来更多临床收益。\n4.HNF1B‐MODY（MODY5）：由于 MODY5 患者合并胰腺发育不良和一定程度的肝胰岛素抵抗，因此对磺脲类药物的反应不敏感，可能需要早期胰岛素治疗。另外，其他并发症和合并症（如肾脏疾病、肝功能不全、血脂异常）也需要积极处理。肾脏管理是HNF1B基因突变患者治疗的一个特别重要的方面，因为这些患者会出现肾功能不全，约一半的MODY5 患者在 45 岁左右进展为终末期肾功能衰竭。MODY5 多合并低镁血症，应注意监测患者电解质情况，适当补镁，维持电解质代谢平衡；部分患者合并早发痛风、高尿酸血症、胰腺外分泌功能下降等均需积极对症处理。\n5. 其他：PDX1‐MODY（MODY4）患者的显著特征是 12 岁以前出现肥胖和高胰岛素血症，故应密切随访与严重高血糖相关的心血管并发症和微血管并发症（如视网膜病变和肾病）。 而 对 于MODY4的治疗，建议使用口服降糖药或胰岛素，如二甲双胍、DDP‐4i，其中大多数MODY4患者需要使用胰岛素才能更好地控制病情。 约 50% 的NEUROD1‐MODY（MODY6）患者仅通过口服降糖药和饮食进行治疗即有效，部分患者在接受胰岛素治疗后，使用格列美脲和二甲双胍治疗仍可以达到控制血糖的效果。KLF11‐MODY（MODY7）发病的初始阶段建议使用胰岛素进行治疗，部分患者可使用口服降糖药物，如二甲双胍、罗格列酮治疗。\n目前，用其他药物对 CEL‐MODY（MODY8）患者进行治疗的方法缺乏证据，建议使用胰岛素治疗；另外，MODY8 患者在儿童期可出现胰腺外分泌功能障碍，合并胰腺外分泌功能障碍患者可予以对症处理。在进行基因诊断前，未确诊的 PAX4‐MODY（MODY9）患者通过饮食或口服降糖药治疗，但在基因诊断后，确诊的患者需要用胰岛素进行治疗。INS‐MODY（MODY10）患者的治疗可以使用口服降糖药、早期服用口服降糖药后改用胰岛素治疗或仅用胰岛素进行治疗。 BLK‐MODY（MODY11）患者多合并肥胖症，因此饮食管理和减重是 MODY11 治疗的重要措施。药物治疗建议使用胰岛素 ，少 数 患者口服降糖药有效。ABCC8‐MODY（MODY12）患者在饮食干预后血糖控制不佳者，建议先使用胰岛素，血糖控制稳定后可转换为口服磺脲类药物。目前，磺脲类药物是KCNJ11‐MODY（MODY13）患者治疗的首 选药物，部分患者可选择胰岛素治疗。 APPL1‐MODY（MODY14）目前的治疗方法包括饮食治疗、使用膳食补充剂（如吡啶甲酸铬和B族维生素等）和胰岛素。\n三、共病管理\nMODY患者也常出现合并症和并发症，需要作相应的处理。\n1. 高血压：改变生活方式，如减重、低盐饮食、增加体力活动。如果生活方式改变 6 个月后血压仍然改善不明显，可以考虑给予血管紧张素转化酶抑制剂治疗，若不能耐受，则选用血管紧张素Ⅱ受体拮抗剂。\n2.高脂血症：建议积极进行饮食调整。若饮食调整6个月后血脂改善不满意，可使用降脂治疗。\n3. 糖尿病肾病：尿微量白蛋白/肌酐比值持续（2次）>30 mg/g，即使血压正常，也要开始使用血管紧张素转化酶抑制剂或血管紧张素Ⅱ受体拮抗剂，目标是微量白蛋白尿正常化。若合并高血压，则应积极治疗高血压。\n4. 糖尿病视网膜病变：增殖性视网膜病变、临床上明显的黄斑水肿或严重的非增殖性视网膜病变，需要激光治疗。\n综上，MODY是一类特殊类型糖尿病，目前有14种亚型。由于其患病率低，起病隐匿，不同亚型的治疗方案常常不同。因此，规范筛查与基因诊断对于制定个体化治疗方案显得十分重要。我们期待，本共识将有助于 MODY 患者得以早期发现、正确诊断、精准治疗，推动 MODY的规范化筛查与诊治。随着对疾病认识的深入和临床证据的增加，我们将对本共识进行更新和修订。\n执笔者：\n蒋晶晶 复旦大学附属中山医院内分泌科\n高陈林 西南医科大学附属医院内分泌科\n周凯欣 重庆第五人民医院大数据研究中心\n郑 丽 中国科学院生物物理研究所\n利益冲突 所有作者声明无利益冲突\n参考文献略\n",

      "problem_en": "Expert medical translation Chinese→English, maintain clinical accuracy: What topic does the following article mainly discuss, and what is the author's viewpoint? The answer should not exceed 150 words.\n\nTwo main causes of gastric ulcers and gastric bleeding in our country are one, Helicobacter pylori infection, and the other, the use of aspirin and some analgesics. As our living conditions improve and society ages, many elderly people with cardiovascular diseases need long-term aspirin therapy. The gastrointestinal damage caused by aspirin has indeed increased compared with the past, but there is no need to worry; as long as prevention and treatment are well managed, this century-old drug aspirin can still help protect cardiovascular health.\n\nOne important question is when aspirin should be taken. Many people may think that taking it after meals won’t harm the stomach—is this true? The answer is also false. The correct statement should be that taking aspirin before meals does not harm the stomach, which may be exactly the opposite of what people think. In fact, we often think that whether taking medication or eating, if something hurts the stomach, it is best to take it after meals. If you take it before meals, it directly contacts the gastric mucosa, which may cause direct damage; taking it after meals, there is food to shield it, making damage less likely.\n\nBut some drugs are like this, and some are different; for example, aspirin. The earliest aspirin we took was ordinary aspirin, which after reaching the stomach dissolves directly, easily injuring the stomach, because it affects cyclooxygenase; COX on one hand is anti-platelet, on the other hand can suppress the repair mechanism of the gastric mucosa—a double-edged sword.\n\nTo avoid this harm, in clinical practice today we mostly use enteric-coated aspirin, i.e., aspirin wrapped with a coating around it. This coating confines the drug so it does not degrade in the stomach, and only dissolves in the intestine, where it is absorbed, thereby reducing local gastric injury.\n\nSo should enteric aspirin be taken before meals or after meals? Here we demonstrate with a simple little experiment to help everyone form a deeper impression. We prepare two test tubes: one contains dilute hydrochloric acid, and the other contains ordinary saline. In each tube, we place one piece of enteric-coated aspirin. Why do this? Because the acidity of dilute hydrochloric acid is similar to gastric acid. When we are fasting, the stomach is mainly acid and there is no other food, so the pH is essentially this acidity. We use this tube to simulate the state of taking aspirin while fasting. The saline tube represents the post-meal stomach pH, because after eating, a large amount of food and fluids enter the stomach, quickly diluting the acidity and moving toward a neutral environment.\n\nWe use the first tube to simulate before meals, the second to simulate after meals. After gently shaking the tubes, after 1 minute the dilute HCl tube shows no change in the aspirin; the supernatant is very clear and intact, i.e., no aspirin has been released. In the saline tube, the supernatant becomes turbid; the surface of the aspirin becomes rough and uneven, the coating has begun to dissolve, and once dissolved, the aspirin inside leaks out. As you can imagine, after another 5–10 minutes all of it would release, making it easy to contact the gastric mucosa and cause local injury, i.e., the so-called stomach damage.\n\nAnother reason aspirin taken on an empty stomach does not injure the stomach is that gastric emptying is fast when fasting; because there is no food after taking the drug, it quickly reaches the intestine and the contact time with the stomach is short. But after a meal, food must empty gradually, and the drug empties more slowly, increasing the contact time between aspirin and the gastric mucosa. Therefore, for these two reasons, post-meal aspirin is not conducive to protecting the stomach. And as time passes, the contrast between taking on an empty stomach and after meals becomes more obvious, although it does not greatly affect efficacy.\n\nFrom this, we see that many facts we take for granted in daily life are actually long-standing misconceptions, requiring us to adjust in daily life to better protect our health.",
      "answer_en": "This article primarily discusses issues related to aspirin use, including the potential for gastrointestinal injury and the appropriate timing of administration. The author argues that, although many people believe taking aspirin after meals protects the stomach, in fact taking aspirin on an empty stomach is more conducive to reducing gastric injury. The author emphasizes that many widely circulated health beliefs may be incorrect and need to be corrected through scientific validation to safeguard health.",

      "problem": "降压药物日剂量和血压水平与卒中发病风险的关系\n作者：\n郑刚[1]\n单位：\n泰达国际心血管病医院[1]\n 高血压是最常见的健康状况之一，估计在美国成年人中的患病率为47%[1-2]。高血压是中风、冠心病、肾病和认知能力下降的一个可改变的危险因素，这使得血压（BP）成为多种疾病预防的重要目标[3]。在高血压的各种后遗症中，高血压的一个特别有害的并发症是中风。中风是美国第五大死亡原因，也是全球第二大常见死亡原因[4-5]。在患有高血压的成年人中，降压药是降低首次或复发性中风风险的最有效方法[6]。即使用降压药控制血压，中风的残余风险仍然存在，中风风险似乎随着根据独特降压药物数量定义的更强化的高血压治疗方案而增加[7]。然而，仅使用降压药类别的计数并不能解释个体药物剂量的增加。\n\n 降压药日剂量（HDD）[8]量化了多种降压药中单个降压药总剂量的强度[1]。标准化HDD单位被定义为提供完全有益效果所需的降压药剂量的50%。例如，氨氯地平的完全有益剂量为每天10mg，每天5mg的氨氯地平剂量等于1的HDD；赖诺普利的完全有益剂量为每天40mg，每天20mg的赖诺普利剂量相当于1的HDD，并结合较小剂量的多种药物（例如，每天10mg的赖诺普利加上每天2.5mg的氨氯地平等于1的HDD；每天40mg的赖诺普里加上每天10mg的氨氯平等于4的HDD）。使用抗高血压治疗强度指标可能比单独使用药物计数更精确地量化药物治疗。总降压药物剂量强度指标与卒中风险之间的关联尚不清楚。\n\n 新近发表了一项研究通过无既往卒中成年人的收缩压和HDD水平来估计卒中事件的风险。研究假设收缩压较高和HDD较高的人患中风的风险更大。该研究从美国48个州招募了30 239名参与者，在平均5.5年的时间里，有344例中风事件。相对于收缩压<120 mm Hg且未服用降压药的情况，收缩压140~159 mm Hg和HDD中间三分位的卒中HR为2.86，收缩压150~159 mmHg和HDD最 高三分位数为2.33，收缩血压≥160 mm Hg和HD中间三分位数为3.08，以及收缩压≥160 mm Hg和HDD最 高三分位数为3.66。收缩压<140 mm Hg的人在HDD水平上的卒中风险相似[9]。\n\n 在一项基于美国的大型队列研究中，对没有普遍中风的黑人和白人成年人进行了研究，发现收缩压<140 mm Hg的人发生中风的风险相似，无论是否使用降压药物或抗高血压治疗强度如何。在收缩压≥140 mm Hg的患者中，HDD>1的患者卒中风险较高。由于HDD为1相当于单一药物最 大有益剂量的一半（或多种药物联合使用时相当于单一药品最 大有益剂量一半），因此观察到服用至少中等剂量降压药的高血压患者中风风险升高。收缩压<140 mm Hg组的卒中风险相似，包括相对于130~139 mm Hg更新的ACC/AHA高血压目标<130 mm Hg，以及纳入FSRP的额外敏感性分析。调整这些额外的卒中风险因素后发现，收缩压≥160 mmHg和HDD≥2.51的患者卒中风险较高，表明该治疗耐药组经历了不利影响。\n\n 血压升高是中风最常见的可改变危险因素。研究血压与中风风险之间相关性的荟萃分析数据表明，收缩压每降低10mmHg，降至115/75mmHg时，60~79岁人群的中风风险降低33%[10]。高血压可通过多种机制导致中风。随着时间的推移，高血压对全身动脉施加的机械应力会导致全身动脉和脑动脉中的平滑肌细胞发生肥大和重塑，从而导致血管狭窄和缺血。此外，高血压导致的血管内皮损伤为动脉粥样硬化斑块的形成创造了有利的环境。这些斑块会破裂并栓塞到大脑，导致缺血性中风[11]。最佳血压控制是预防中风事件的主要策略，尽管降压药驱动的血压降低在多大程度上降低了高血压的中风风险尚不清楚。\n\n 2015年的一项REGARDS分析按观察到的收缩压水平和BP药物计数对样本人群进行了分层，结果表明，尽管血压相似，但患有高血压和大量降压药物的成年人比服用较少降压药物的人有更大的中风风险[7]。参与者分为4个BP类别：正常血压、高血压前期、1期高血压和2期高血压；对于收缩压较高的3个阶层的人来说，服用更多类别的降压药的人中风风险更高[7]。当根据服用降压药参与者的类别数量进行分层时，研究发现，那些不服用任何药物的人在每个连续的收缩压阶层都有更高的中风风险。那些服用1或2类降压药的人在血压水平较高时中风风险较高，但与未服用药物的人相比，增加幅度较小。计算降压药物类别的数量可能会错误地分类降压药物治疗的强度，因为服用低剂量多种类别药物的个体的整体抗高血压强度可能低于服用最 大剂量单一药物的个体。\n\n 上述分析纳入了HDD指标，这是一个经过验证的指标，汇总了多种药物类别中降压药物的累积剂量，以量化多种药物的降压治疗强度。研究观察到，当收缩压<140 mm Hg时，低剂量或高剂量强度的降压药治疗会产生类似的卒中风险。研究没有观察到需要药物治疗的收缩压<140 mm Hg患者的残余卒中风险，无论其强度如何。因此，如果血压水平降至收缩压阈值140 mm Hg以下，通过药物治疗进行强化降血压可能会降低中风风险。这与之前的REGARDS分析形成鲜明对比，该分析观察到，无论收缩压水平如何，服用更多类BP药物的患者都有残余卒中风险[7]。\n\n 目前的发现在几个方面推进了科学知识的发展。ACC和AHA提出的当前高血压指南建议，在各种风险和合并症中，收缩压治疗目标应为<130 mmHg，并引用了个别研究和荟萃分析，这些研究和分析报告称，随着收缩压从<120 mmHg增加到120~129 mmHg，再到130~139 mmHg，心血管疾病风险逐渐升高[12]。这些更新的高血压指南尚未得到普遍接受[13-14]。在目前的分析中，没有观察到收缩压较低的组别介导的不同卒中风险（即，与130~139 mmHg相比，收缩压<120 mmHg的患者的卒中风险并不低）。这些发现支持收缩压目标<140 mm Hg以减少中风，并与SPRINT试验等试验一致，SPRINT试验将血压降至<120 mmHg以下，但与急性心力衰竭的减少相比，中风的相对减少较少[6]。一种可能的解释是，这项分析仅关注不同收缩压和HDD水平下的中风风险，而AHA/ACC指南引用了SPRINT试验等研究，这些研究的主要结局是心肌梗死、心力衰竭和急性冠状动脉综合征，此外还有中风[6]。\n\n 有趣的是，这一分析还表明，收缩压在140~159 mm Hg和≥160 mm Hg范围内，并且没有服用药物或服用量低的人。药物（HDD=0和1）不会增加中风的风险。这一人群可能代表“白大褂高血压”，这是一种由于测量环境或情况导致个人血压读数错误升高的现象，通常是因为这些测量是在诊所或由医疗保健专业人员进行的。这意味着，由于这些短暂升高的血压读数，这些参与者可能会被错误地归类为收缩压较高的类别，但他们的身体不会受到持续升高的血压带来的相同慢性机械应力的影响，因此不会以更高的中风风险的形式出现同样的后遗症。该组的另一种可能解释是，第2次就诊是他们第一次被诊断为高血压，随后他们接受了抗高血压治疗，将收缩压控制在<140 mm Hg，这将有效地将他们改变为<140 mmHg的类别，并继续支持上述的结论，即无论使用多少降压药，血压<140 mmHg的各组中风风险相似。\n\n这篇文章得出了什么结论，字数不要超过300字。",
      "sanswer": "文章得出的主要结论是：在收缩压低于140 mm Hg的患者中，无论降压药物的日剂量（HDD）如何，中风风险相似。而在收缩压高于或等于140 mm Hg的患者中，HDD较高的患者中风风险显著增加。这表明，对于血压控制在140 mm Hg以下的患者，进一步增加降压药物剂量并不会带来额外的中风风险降低。而对于血压较高的患者，强化降压治疗可以有效降低中风风险。此外，文章还指出，对于收缩压在140159 mm Hg和≥160 mm Hg范围内但未服用或仅服用低剂量降压药物的患者，中风风险并未增加，这可能与“白大褂高血压”现象有关。",

      "problem_en": "Conclusion: Using the validated hypertension drug daily dose (HDD), this study quantifies antihypertensive treatment intensity across drug classes and shows that the relationship between total antihypertensive exposure and stroke risk is largely determined by achieved SBP. Specifically, among adults with SBP <140 mmHg, stroke risk is similar across HDD levels, suggesting that merely increasing drug dose when SBP is controlled does not confer additional stroke protection. By contrast, in participants with SBP ≥140 mmHg, higher HDD is associated with higher stroke risk, particularly when both SBP is very high (≥160 mmHg) and HDD is high (≥2.5). Some subgroups with SBP 140–159 or ≥160 mmHg and HDD 0–1 did not show increased risk, a pattern compatible with white-coat hypertension or with patients who, after a second assessment, initiated treatment and achieved SBP <140 mmHg, which would reduce ongoing exposure and stroke risk. Overall, the findings argue for targeting SBP <140 mmHg to reduce stroke risk and are broadly compatible with prior work such as REGARDS and SPRINT, though the magnitude of stroke risk reduction with aggressive lowering may be smaller than that for heart failure. HDD offers a more precise instrument than drug-class counts for quantifying antihypertensive treatment intensity and advances our understanding of how BP level and treatment intensity jointly shape stroke risk.",
      "answer_en": "The main conclusion of the article is: In patients with systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg, the risk of stroke is similar regardless of the daily dose of antihypertensive drugs (HDD). Conversely, in patients with systolic blood pressure at or above 140 mm Hg, those with higher HDD have a significantly increased risk of stroke. This indicates that for patients whose blood pressure is controlled below 140 mm Hg, further increasing the antihypertensive medication dose does not yield an additional reduction in stroke risk. For patients with higher blood pressure, intensified antihypertensive therapy can effectively reduce stroke risk. In addition, the article notes that for patients with systolic blood pressure in the range of 140–159 mm Hg and ≥160 mm Hg who are not taking antihypertensive medications or are taking only low-dose antihypertensive drugs, the risk of stroke did not increase, which may be related to the phenomenon of 'white coat hypertension'.",

      "sanswer": "这篇文章的主要研究结论是无创通气治疗在重症肺炎导致的呼吸衰竭患者中显著优于常规治疗。具体来说，无创通气组患者在治疗后的血气分析指标、临床有效率、并发症发生率、治疗时间、呼吸频率和心率等方面均优于对照组。无创通气不仅提高了治疗效果，还减少了并发症的发生率和缩短了治疗时间。\n\n作者的观点是无创通气作为一种治疗重症肺炎并发呼吸衰竭的有效手段，其操作简单、安全性高，并且在改善患者的通气和氧合功能方面具有显著优势。虽然无创通气也存在一些缺点，如可能导致漏气和胃胀气，但通过医护人员的积极护理和指导可以有效解决这些问题。",

      "problem_en": "Summarize the main research conclusions of the following article; what viewpoint do the authors articulate accordingly:\n\nSevere pneumonia refers to a type of pneumonia in which pulmonary infection signs cannot be effectively controlled after comprehensive treatment [1]. Clinically, this disease often leads to patients developing functional respiratory failure, and its most important emergency measure is the use of mechanical ventilation [2]. In clinical practice, the use of noninvasive ventilation can significantly reduce patient mortality, as it does not require creating an artificial airway; it primarily uses a mask connected to the patient’s mouth and nose to perform positive pressure ventilation, greatly reducing the rate of tracheal intubation and avoiding further injury to the patient’s airway [3]. This study retrospectively analyzed data from 152 patients diagnosed with severe pneumonia causing respiratory failure at our hospital from January 2014 to March 2015; the findings are reported below.\n\n1. Subjects and Methods\n1.1 Subjects\nA retrospective analysis of 152 patients diagnosed with severe pneumonia causing respiratory failure at our hospital from January 2014 to March 2015 [4]. Based on the method of adjunctive ventilation therapy received, patients were assigned to a noninvasive ventilation (NIV) group (n=76) and a conventional treatment group (n=76). In the NIV group, 51 were male and 25 were female, aged 45–78 years, with a mean age of (75.5 ± 6.9) years; in the control group, 43 were male and 33 were female, aged 42–81 years, with a mean age of (76.8 ± 5.1) years. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in age, gender, or pretreatment blood gas analysis, making them comparable.\n\n1.2 Inclusion criteria:\n(1) Bilateral auscultation showing rales; (2) high fever accompanied by respiratory symptoms; (3) complete blood count showing elevated leukocytes and neutrophils; (4) positive sputum culture for pathogens; (5) chest X-ray showing bilateral infiltrates; (6) blood pressure with systolic < 90 mmHg and diastolic < 60 mmHg, with signs of infectious shock.\n\n1.3 Exclusion criteria:\n(1) Respiratory depression or arrest; (2) cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmias, hypotension, myocardial infarction; (3) airways with大量 secretions or viscous sputum.\n\n1.4 Methods\nConventional treatment group: First, provide routine anti-infection therapy. Initially alleviate the patient’s respiratory status, and during nutritional support administer bronchodilators (salbutamol aerosol inhalation) to dilate the bronchi and relieve bronchospasm, correct electrolyte disturbances, administer glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone 200 mg), and provide standard cough suppression, bronchodilation, and expectoration therapies. Concurrently with routine nursing, provide continuous low-flow nasal oxygen therapy.\n\nNoninvasive ventilation (NIV) group: Use a noninvasive ventilator model EvitalV produced by Dräger (Germany) in conjunction with standard basic treatment. Select appropriate masks for different patients, and before initiating ventilation, make micro-adjustments within the following ranges according to the patient’s physiologic status: inspiratory pressure 1.16–1.764 kPa, expiratory pressure 0.294–0.784 kPa, FiO2 40%–55%, and respiratory rate 10–16 breaths/min. At treatment onset, patients receive NIV 2–3 times daily, each session lasting 3–6 hours [5]. Based on clinical improvement, adjust the ventilator parameters; to prevent airway suction blockage by secretions, enhance airway care to maintain airway patency.\n\n1.5 Outcome measures\nCompare the two groups’ respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood gas analysis before and after treatment. Observe treatment duration, incidence of complications during treatment, and efficacy. Efficacy criteria: (1) Markedly effective: clinical symptoms significantly relieved within 12–24 hours, blood gas indices normalized; (2) Effective: clinical symptoms partially relieved within 24 hours, blood gas indices not yet normalized; (3) Ineffective: symptoms not relieved or worsened within 24 hours. Total effective rate = (markedly effective + effective) / total number × 100%.\n\n1.6 Statistical methods\nData were analyzed with SPSS 21.0. Normal-distribution data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (±s); non-normally distributed data are expressed as medians. Intergroup comparisons used independent samples t-tests. Categorical variables were analyzed with the chi-squared test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n2. Results\n2.1 Comparison of blood gas analysis before and after treatment between the two groups\nBefore treatment, there were no significant differences in various indices between the groups; after treatment, the differences between groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). In the control group, pH before and after treatment showed no significant change, while PaO2 and PaCO2 changed significantly compared with pretreatment; in the NIV group, after treatment, the indices differed significantly from pretreatment.

Conclusion\nThe current pathophysiology of severe pneumonia primarily involves destruction of the alveolar walls due to inflammation around the small airways; combined with reduced pulmonary ventilation function and increased residual gas in peripheral lung tissue, this leads to alveolar dilation and inter-alveolar septal rupture, with subsequent fusion between alveoli [6]. Fundamentally, the major issue is that inflammatory cell infiltration in the small airways of patients with severe pneumonia has caused narrowing or obstruction and atelectasis. When the condition worsens, patients experience severe hypoxemia and carbon dioxide retention, resulting in functional respiratory failure [7-8]. Because noninvasive ventilation is clinically used as a primary treatment for obstructive lung disease and respiratory failure [9], its main mechanism is to provide the patient with a higher inspiratory pressure and a lower expiratory pressure to counteract the body’s own respiratory pressures. The higher inspiratory pressure can reduce the body's oxygen consumption and suppress CO2 production, as it overcomes airway resistance and increases ventilation. Together with the lower expiratory pressure, it can improve the lungs’ oxygen content, enhance alveolar oxygenation, increase ventilation, and improve the patient’s ventilatory status [10-11]. NIV is simple to operate and has high safety [12]. Zhou Xiaoqing et al. [13], in a study of 64 patients with COPD and respiratory failure treated with NIV compared with invasive ventilation, found a clinical effective rate of 94.74% for NIV, with complication rates such as pneumonia and related pulmonary infections at only 3.74%; invasive ventilation had an efficacy of 66.26% with complications at 13.26%. However, NIV also has evident drawbacks: if patient cooperation is inadequate, air leaks and abdominal distension can occur, and clearance of secretions from the airway can be difficult. But these issues can be resolved if healthcare staff are more attentive in patient care. In NIV, nursing staff play an important role because these patients are often elderly, physically frail, and prone to relapse, with unstable psychological states requiring highly patient-guided nursing care.",
      "answer_en": "The main conclusion of this study is that noninvasive ventilation therapy for respiratory failure caused by severe pneumonia is significantly superior to conventional treatment. Specifically, in the noninvasive ventilation group, arterial blood gas analysis parameters, clinical effectiveness rate, incidence of complications, treatment duration, respiratory rate, and heart rate after treatment were all better than those in the control group. Noninvasive ventilation not only improved treatment effectiveness but also reduced the incidence of complications and shortened the treatment duration.\n\nThe authors' view is that noninvasive ventilation, as an effective means of treating severe pneumonia with concomitant respiratory failure, is easy to operate, has high safety, and has significant advantages in improving the patient's ventilation and oxygenation function. Although noninvasive ventilation also has some drawbacks, such as possible air leaks and gastric distension, these issues can be effectively addressed through proactive nursing care and guidance by healthcare professionals.",

"我是做微信公众号的，主要是给中老年人推送一些简单知识，今天需要给大家简单介绍一下老年冠心病以及康复需要注意的事项，大概总结一下文章，用100字说明一下中老年人需要关注的最核心的点。\n老年冠心病全周期康复中国专家共识\n作者：\n学协会[1]\n单位：\n学协会[1]\n\n冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病(简称冠心病)是影响老年(≥65岁)人群健康的主要原因之一,患病率随年龄增大而增加。1999年中国已经进入人口老龄化时代。2020年第七次全国人口普查报告,我国65岁以上人口约1.9亿,占总人口数的13.50%。与2010年第六次全国人口普查相比,65岁及以上人口的比重上升4.63%。人口老龄化进程地不断加快,老年人的健康管理已迫在眉睫。\n人口老龄化是冠心病发病率上升的原因之一,随着全球老龄化进程加速,目前中国60岁及以上人口比例已高达16%,预计到2050年这一比例将增加到35%,冠心病是50~74岁及75岁以上老年人的主要死亡原因,这提示我国的数量将会迅速增加。老年冠心病患者发病的主要原因是由于老年人体内的脂质代谢出现功能衰退,导致原本平滑的动脉血管内膜出现了部分血液脂质,这些血液内的脂质随着人体的血流运行,逐渐形成类似粥样的白色物质,最终导致人体动脉腔出现阻塞或者狭窄。冠心病不仅威胁着老年人群的身体健康,更是对家庭和社会造成沉重的负担。\n冠心病的发生和发展受多种因素的影响,由于老年人常合并有高血压、糖尿病、高脂血症等多种基础疾病,冠状动脉常呈多支、弥漫、钙化、慢性完全性闭塞等病变,易于发生急性心肌梗死(acute myocardial infarction,AMI),极大地增加了死亡风险。结合《中国心血管健康与疾病报告2020》和《2015年中国卫生和计划生育统计年鉴》,我国AMI病死率随增龄而增加,40岁开始上升,其递增趋势近似于指数关系。因此,老年人群冠心病防治任务日趋严峻,如何通过心脏康复降低老年心血管事件的再发生率、延长长者寿命已成为研究热点。\n老年冠心病康复是以运动为基础的心脏康复,辅以日常生活活动、认知、社会心理等一系列干预措施,延缓或逆转疾病的进展,提高长者的生存质量。老年冠心病患者基础疾病较多,存在多器官功能衰退,导致其对运动的耐受性差,故老年人心脏康复的依从性较低。目前国内尚无针对老年冠心病康复治疗的指南,为进一步规范老年冠心病患者心脏康复内容,在国家卫生健康委员会相关部门的支持下,由国家重点研发计划“老年全周期康复技术体系与信息化管理研究(2018YFC2002300)”项目组牵头,组织国内老年冠心病康复、医护等多领域的专家撰写本共识,本共识旨在从冠心病全周期康复和老年综合评估的角度提供老年冠心病患者的全周期康复评估和治疗内容,为不同级别机构的康复工作者提供老年冠心病康复的安全性及有效性的科学指导,推动我国老年冠心病全周期康复工作的开展。\n1. 老年冠心病患者的特点\n冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病(coronary atherosclerotic heart disease,CHD)是冠状动脉发生粥样硬化病变而引起冠状动脉狭窄或闭塞,导致心肌缺血缺氧甚至坏死的心脏病。欧洲心脏病学会颁布《2019版慢性冠状动脉综合征诊断和治疗指南》,将CAD重新分类为急性冠脉综合征(acute coronary syndromes,ACS)和慢性冠脉综合征(chronic coronary syndrome,CCS)。\n老年冠心病患者常伴有心血管系统、呼吸系统、消化系统等均发生退行性改变,并发症风险增加,机体适应性降低,功能储备能力下降,肌肉数量和质量降低,身体素质和运动能力减退,平衡能力差,跌倒风险高,且易存在社会心理问题。此外,老年冠心病患者因基础疾病较多需要多重用药,导致药物之间的不良作用增多。以上特点对老年冠心病患者的康复提出了新要求。\n2. 老年冠心病患者常见功能障碍\n老年冠心病患者个体差异很大,病情往往比较复杂。除了常合并一定程度的心肺功能和运动功能障碍外,还可能伴有认知功能、睡眠障碍、精神心理障碍,极少数会出现感觉功能、二便功能、语言及吞咽功能障碍。\n2.1 心功能障碍\n冠心病是引发心功能障碍最常见的病因之一。由于老年冠心病患者的心肌缺血缺氧、弥漫性纤维组织增生、心肌纤维萎缩或减少甚至坏死等病变,会影响心肌的舒张和收缩功能,使心脏泵血功能发生紊乱,心输出量和运输氧气的能力也随之下降。\n2.2 肺功能障碍\n长期的心功能下降会导致组织器官灌注降低、心脏射血功能下降致肺循环瘀血、通气/血流比值变化等问题,进而会影响老年冠心病患者的肺功能。心脏术后长时间的卧床也会增加肺部感染、气道阻塞或肺不张的风险。冠心病患者的用力肺活量(forced vital capacity,FVC)、肺活量(vital capacity,VC)、第一秒用力呼气容积(forced expiatory volume in one second,FEV1)和肺-氧化碳弥散量(diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide,DLCO)均低于健康人,表明其肺功能下降较为明显。FEV1的下降程度不仅与慢性心功能不全呈正比,还与冠状动脉狭窄严重程度明显相关。有研究报道,肺功能的下降作为冠心病独立危险因素,可使冠心病的发生风险和心血管病死亡率增加。\n2.3 运动功能障碍\n老年冠心病患者由于年龄增长、卧床时间延长等原因,会对心肺功能及体能产生不良影响。机体在运动时心率随运动负荷增加而增快,通常每增加1代谢当量(metabolic equivalent,MET),心率增加10次/min。因此,老年冠心病患者在运动时易引起心动过速等心律失常,进而限制患者的运动功能。\n2.4 认知功能障碍\n研究显示,老年冠心病患者认知障碍的发病率为28%~41.89%,主要认知障碍的领域为记忆力、抽象思维和视空间执行能力。冠心病与大脑特定区域的灰质丢失相关,且这些特定区域对认知功能和行为具有重要的影响。冠心病还可造成大脑的小血管病变,引起神经元的缺血性变性和凋亡,从而损害患者的认知功能。冠心病与痴呆及轻度认知障碍(mild cognitive impairment,MCI)均存在相关性。研究发现,冠心病是不同阶段、不同分型认知功能障碍的危险因素之一。\n2.5 精神心理障碍\n老年冠心病患者合并精神心理障碍发生率高,其焦虑、抑郁患者也易发冠心病,冠心病与焦虑、抑郁互为致病因素。研究表明,冠心病患者合并焦虑、抑郁等情绪障碍的比例及严重程度均高于非冠心病人群。《冠心病康复与二级预防中国专家共识》指出,心血管疾病患者普遍患有精神心理障碍,并提出为患者提供“生物-心理-社会”的全新服务模式。\n2.6 睡眠障碍\n睡眠障碍是老年冠心病常见的影响因素之一。研究表明,睡眠障碍(睡眠时间<6h/d)或睡眠过多(睡眠时间>9h/d)是健康成年人(年龄>35岁,无心脏病史)罹患冠心病的独立危险因素,也是冠心病患者抑郁的标志。\n2.7 社会功能障碍\n老年冠心病患者常因心肺功能下降、身体机能减退、精神心理压力等导致社会功能障碍,拒绝参与社交活动,经常在家中卧床休息,很少活动,进而造成更为严重的社会心理问题。研究表明,早期康复、全周期康复、医院与社区协同健康教育管理均可改善老年冠心病患者的心理健康状态、社会功能与生活质量。\n2.8 日常活动参与障碍\n老年冠心病患者常伴随日常生活活动参与受限的问题,及时准确的日常生活活动能力评估与日常生活活动指导是冠心病康复的主要工作之一。应根据运动负荷试验测试患者最 大代谢当量,将日常活动的代谢当量值与患者的最 大代谢当量进行匹对,指导患者选择安全的、合适的日常活动。\n3. 老年综合评估\n老年患者作为一个特殊群体,常因共病和多重用药史导致老年冠心病患者病情变得复杂。除了常合并一定程度的心肺功能和运动功能障碍外,还可能伴有认知功能、睡眠障碍、精神心理障碍等,美国老年医学会指南建议,对于老年患者还应重点关注衰弱、认知功能、抑郁、功能状态、跌倒风险、营养状况、用药史、合并症、心理健康和社会环境状况等评估。有研究显示冠心病、合并症和老年综合征交互影响,加重了老年冠心病疾病负担,也加剧了与年龄相关的身体功能下降,生活质量降低和医疗保健利用率提高等。有老年综合征的患者患心血管疾病风险增加,而且在大多数的老年心血管疾病患者中,合并老年综合征的患者具有更差的临床预后,这些特点都对老年冠心病患者的康复提出了新的要求和挑战。因此,老年综合征的评估应该纳入到老年冠心病患者的治疗决策和康复计划中,为制定有效的预防、治疗、康复于一体的老年患者康复方案提供理论依据。为促进老年冠心病患者功能能力的改善,提高生命质量和健康期望寿命,建议基于《国际功能、残疾和健康分类》(international classification of functioning,disability and health,ICF)框架,结合老年综合评估内容,对老年冠心病患者进行整体评估。\n3.1 一般状态及临床评估\n包括系统询问患者的病史及目前用药情况、心肺系统体格检查、影像学检查、实验室检查、静态心功能评估、营养状态评定、肌少症、衰弱、跌倒风险评估等,其中国际衰弱和肌肉减少症研究会议特别工作组强烈建议对于65岁及以上的老年人,应使用适用于特定环境或背景下的简单、经过验证的衰弱工具进行衰弱筛查,中国老年学和老年医学学会建议老年冠心病患者的衰弱评估筛查采用国际老年营养和保健学会提出的FRAIL量表。\n3.2 心功能评估\n常用心功能评估方法纽约心脏病协会(new york heart association,NYHA)心功能分级、Killip分级、Forrest血流动力学心功能分级、Weber心功能分级及6min步行能力测试。见表1。以NYHA心功能分级为例,对患者心功能进行评估分级如下:Ⅰ级:心脏病患者日常活动量不受限制,一般体力活动不引起过度疲劳、心悸、气喘或心绞痛。Ⅱ级:心脏病患者的体力活动轻度受限制、休息时无自觉症状,一般体力活动引起过度疲劳、心悸、气喘或心绞痛。Ⅲ级:患者有心脏病,以致体力活动明显受限制。休息时无症状,但小于一般体力活动即可引起过度疲劳、心悸、气喘或心绞痛。Ⅳ级:心脏病患者不能从事任何体力活动,休息状态下也出现心衰症状,体力活动后加重。\n\n3.3 肺功能评估\n常采用临床肺功能检测,评估肺容积、肺通气、肺换气及小气道等肺功能的表现。肺功能评估还可包括戒烟状态的评估。若患者有呼吸困难,可采用Borg呼吸困难量表评估。\n3.4 运动功能评估\n3.4.1 运动功能评定\n老年冠心病患者运动功能评定主要内容为肌力、肌耐力、平衡和柔韧度评定、见表2。\n\n3.4.2 运动风险评估\n老年冠心病患者在制定运动处方前须进行运动风险评估,运动负荷试验和危险分层是运动风险评估中的重点内容,为制定运动处方提供安全保障。\n3.4.2.1 运动负荷试验运动\n负荷试验用于评估心肺功能状态,观察运动时血液动力学的变化、有无心肌缺血、运动是否诱发或加重心律失常,计算有氧运动时目标心率及运动耐量。由于运动负荷试验风险大,老年冠心病患者应谨慎应用。运动负荷试验包括仪器法运动负荷试验和6min步行测试。仪器法运动负荷试验一般采用踏车或平板运动形式,包括心电图运动负荷试验和心肺运动试验(cardio pulmonary exercise test,CPET),其中CPET更为准确,但对评估者的操作质量和结果判读能力要求较高。老年冠心病患者在进行运动负荷试验时应严格掌握其绝对、相对禁忌证,以及运动试验终止的绝对、相对禁忌证,具体内容可参照《冠心病患者运动治疗中国专家共识》。\n3.4.2.2 危险分层\n老年冠心病患者运动康复的危险分层参照美国医师学会卫生及公共政策专业委员会于1988年颁布的标准。见表3。\n\n3.5 认知功能评估\n采用蒙特利尔认知评定(montreal cognitive assessment,MoCA)、简易精神状态评定(mini-mental state xamination,MMSE)进行认知功能筛查,MoCA涵盖的认知领域较MMSE更广,且在区别健康老年人与轻度认知功能障碍人群时准确性更高,其可专门用于筛查老年人轻度认知功能障碍。\n3.6 精神心理评估\n研究表明,心血管疾病群体中抑郁症的患病率在25%~40%之间,明显高于健康人群。罹患中至重度抑郁症状患者的全因死亡率增加,包括心血管疾病和缺血性心脏病的相关死亡。约1/3的冠心病患者在心理应激情况下可能发生心肌缺血,即为压力诱发心肌缺血(mental stressinduced myocardial ischemi,MSIMI)。因此,老年综合能力评估应涵盖心理评估,常用的量表包括焦虑自评量表、抑郁自评量表、汉密尔顿焦虑量表、汉密尔顿抑郁量表、医院焦虑抑郁量表、老年抑郁量表等。\n3.7 日常生活活动能力评估\n日常生活活动分为基础性日常生活活动(basic activities of daily life,BADL)和工具性日常生活活动(instrumental activities of daily life,IADL),可采用提问法、观察法和量表评定法进行评估。BADL是指维持人最基本的生存、生活需要所必须每日反复进行的活动,临床一般采用Barthel指数或改良Barthel指数、功能独立性评定量表进行评估。IADL指维持人独立生活进行活动时使用一些工具的能力,临床一般采用社会功能活动问卷和Lawton-Brody工具性日常生活活动功能评估量表进行评价。\n3.8 环境评估\n对于老年冠心病患者进行环境因素评估主要包括居住环境、公共环境和交流环境的评估。在老年冠心病综合评估服务中应重点进行居家安全的评估,这在预防老年人的跌倒中具有特殊重要的意义。评估居住环境可采用老年居家环境综合评估与改造方案、居家跌倒与意外筛查工具、住宅评估概况表、功能与康复环境安全评估健康结果测量与评价、居家安全简易评估等,通常在开始计划出院时进行。\n4. 老年冠心病常见功能障碍康复\n常见功能障碍康复内容包括心肺功能障碍、心理障碍、认知障碍的康复训练。\n4.1 心脏功能康复\n4.1.1 运动康复\n研究证实,大于65岁冠心病患者接受运动康复,可以改善代谢指标、心功能和运动能力,且治疗效果可持续12个月。运动康复与老年心肌梗死患者心功能之间存在剂量—反应关系,运动康复次数越多,心脏功能效益越好。有专家共识提出,应根据危险分层为老年稳定性冠心病患者制定运动康复处方,即低危患者可在无监护条件中适当锻炼、中危患者体力活动时应密切监测、高危患者需慎用运动处方。\n4.1.2 体外心脏震波治疗\n体外心脏震波治疗作为针对冠状动脉微血管再血管化治疗的一种有效手段,能够有效地治疗顽固性心绞痛,明显改善患者的临床症状及生活质量,提高心力衰竭患者的运动耐量,可成为冠心病治疗策略的重要补充,是针对严重冠心病的一种新型的治疗方法。\n4.1.3 体外反搏治疗\n体外反搏治疗特有的双脉动血流方式,可提高血流切应力,保护血管内皮功能,降低血浆中的炎性因子和黏附因子,抑制心血管疾病的促炎反应,延缓动脉粥样硬化进展。体外反搏治疗具有较好的临床疗效和安全性,可作为老年冠心病心脏康复的一种无创性补充治疗技术。\n4.1.4 传统中医康复\n中医传统功法在老年冠心病患者的心脏康复的应用疗效已被越来越多的患者和临床工作者认可,如:太极拳、八段锦、养生气功等,尤其适合中高危或运动能力较差的老年冠心病患者。此外,中医药膳也被纳入老年冠心病康复辅助治疗。\n4.2 肺功能康复\n4.2.1 戒烟宣教\n接诊老年冠心病患者时,应询问患者主动和被动吸烟情况。面对吸烟患者,需采用明确清晰的态度建议患者戒烟,为吸烟患者提供戒烟咨询服务,并制定戒烟计划。采用尼古丁依赖检验量表进行评估,对尼古丁依赖程度较高者,建议采用药物治疗联合行为干预疗法以提高戒烟成功率。\n4.2.2 呼吸训练\n可采用运动训练、吸气肌训练、缩唇呼吸、深呼吸、腹式呼吸、膈肌呼吸、计算机辅助的呼吸反馈训练,可使用主动呼吸循环技术清除支气管分泌物,改善肺功能。\n4.3 精神心理康复\n对于重度焦虑、抑郁老年冠心病患者,需转诊至精神专科会诊或转诊至精神专科进行治疗。对于中、轻度焦虑抑郁患者,尤其是伴有躯体症状的患者,需对症治疗,包括心理干预、放松训练、音乐疗法、健康教育、运动康复和抗抑郁药物治疗等。\n4.4 认知康复\n针对老年冠心病患者的认知功能障碍,可采用一对一桌面训练、情景模拟训练、认知游戏、虚拟现实技术等多种综合性训练模式进行干预。\n4.5 健康教育\n院内康复期是老年冠心病患者最容易接受健康教育的时期,该时期可为患者分析发病诱因,避免再次发病。为患者科普冠心病相关知识,避免不必要的紧张和焦虑,控制冠心病危险因素,提高患者对药物的依从性。纠正不良的生活方式,包括合理膳食,科学的运动,改变不良生活习惯(戒烟、限酒),控制体重,睡眠管理等。\n5. 老年冠心病全周期康复\n老年冠心病康复的全周期管理是心血管疾病综合性管理的医疗模式,是包括运动治疗康复在内的心理-生物-社会综合医疗保健。老年冠心病全周期康复包括“疾病全周期”、“参与人员全周期”、“空间全周期”3个维度。见图1。老年冠心病全周期康复模式的提出对于提高冠心病诊疗水平、实施分级诊疗策略、人员功能定位、消除地区间医疗资源的不平衡提供了建设性意见。老年冠心病全周期能让临床工作者更好地了解心脏康复不同分期并且给予针对性康复训练,实现患者的功能预后最 优化。\n\n5.1 疾病全周期\n老年冠心病疾病全周期不仅包括病因预防、临床前期预防、三级预防的基本内容,更需采用心肺运动试验专项评估对未患病老年人群实行健康与亚健康管理与跟踪,实现发病前“零级预防”。针对潜在冠心病高危老年人群,应加强危险因素,如高血压、高血糖、高血脂、肥胖、吸烟等的管理,同时密切监控健康指标变化,做到早发现、早诊断、早治疗、根据《中国心脏康复与二级预防指南2018精要》与美国ACC/AHA心脏康复质控报告,对已确诊的老年冠心病患者实施疾病全周期的三级康复,即院内康复期、院外早期康复/门诊康复期、院外长期康复期。\n5.1.1Ⅰ期心脏康复(院内康复期)\n为急性期住院的冠心病患者提供康复和预防服务。Ⅰ期康复的目标是缩短住院时间、促进日常生活及运动能力的恢复、增加患者自信心、减少心理负担、减少再入院率、预防卧床所致并发症及指导戒烟,为Ⅱ期康复提供全面完整的病情信息和准备。\nⅠ期心脏康复主要内容包括:早期病情综合评估、疾病自我管理能力培训、生活方式改变指导(戒烟限酒、合理膳食、科学运动、睡眠管理)、循证用药(个体化调整药物类别和剂量、控制危险因素和提高用药依从性)。Ⅰ期心脏康复具体院内评估内容、身体活动、运动指导和健康教育内容参考《冠心病患者运动治疗中国专家共识》和《中国心血管疾病康复/二级预防指南(2015版)》。Ⅰ期心脏康复的适应证与禁忌证。见表4。\n\n值得强调的是,Ⅰ期心脏康复的运动康复和日常活动指导必须在心电、血压监护下进行,例如:仰卧位到坐位、坐位到站立位、站立到行走等一系列活动。如活动时无不良反应,可循序渐进增加活动量至患者可耐受水平;如活动时出现不良反应,无论坐位或站位,都需立即终止活动,重新由低一个级别的运动量开始,循序渐进提升运动强度。Ⅰ期心脏康复早期运动康复和日常生活指导计划可参照“冠心病患者运动治疗中国专家共识”。出院前应对每例患者进行运动风险评估,目的是评估患者出院后活动风险,指导患者出院后日常活动,同时提供出院后运动处方或Ⅱ期康复建议。\n5.1.2 Ⅱ期心脏康复(院外早期康复或门诊康复期)\n一般在出院1~6月进行,PCI、CABG后常规2~5周进行。Ⅱ期康复的主要内容包括:综合评估、危险分层、循证用药、控制危险因素、改变不良生活方式,涉及运动处方、营养处方、戒烟处方及心理处方。该时期采用个体化病例管理模式,通过对每位患者的综合评估,制定个性化危险因素干预目标,以患者为中心,与患者达成共同一致的短期和长期目标。该模式在坚持危险因素的总体干预原则同时兼顾个体化原则,同时充分考虑患者的意愿和接受能力,因而实施起来更为有效。Ⅱ期心脏康复是Ⅰ期康复的延续和Ⅲ期康复的基础,起着承上启下的枢纽作用。Ⅱ期心脏康复的适应证与禁忌证,详见表5。\n5.1.3 Ⅲ期心脏康复(院外长期康复)\n为心血管事件1年后的院外患者提供预防和康复服务,是Ⅱ期心脏康复的延续。该时期的部分患者已恢复日常活动和工作,Ⅲ期康复的关键是维持已形成的健康生活方式和运动习惯,仍需继续纠正心血管危险因素和加强心理社会支持。另外,运动指导应因人而异,低危患者的运动康复无需医学监护,中、高危患者的运动康复中仍需医学监护。因此,对患者继续跟进评估危险分层十分重要,低危及部分中危患者可进一步Ⅲ期康复,高危及部分中危患者应转上级医院继续康复。\n5.2 参与人员全周期\n老年冠心病康复工作人员由心内科医师、心脏康复医师、康复治疗师、专科护士、营养师、心理医师、社会工作者和患者家庭成员等组成。心内科医师负责患者的药物治疗,心脏康复医师负责对患者进行系统评估,把控风险、制定心脏康复方案。康复治疗师负责物理治疗、作业治疗等。对于开胸心脏术后、依赖呼吸机辅助呼吸以及全身衰竭、呼吸肌无力的冠心病患者,康复治疗师需提供专业心肺物理治疗和呼吸训练。心脏康复专科护士负责建立心脏康复患者档案、记录评估数据、监测并指导患者在病房延续日常生活活动。社会工作者和家庭成员则是老年冠心病患者社区、家庭康复及预防的核心力量,是全周期模式中重要的一环。全周期康复模式下,可由治疗师提供远程康复指导,通过“云沟通”方式对患者进行实时居家康复指导、实时监督运动强度与心肺功能变化、及时反馈康复效果,提升患者对家庭/社区康复的主观能动性,增强其自我管理意识。\n5.3 空间全周期\n空间全周期涵盖发病前的危险因素控制、发病时临床诊治及发病后的医院、社区、居家康复各阶段。老年冠心病患者全周期康复需要各级医疗机构配合,由于全国各地生活水平、地域特点、医疗水平、诊疗模式等存在差异,不同地区可根据各自特点完善康复体系和服务流程。对于病情复杂、技术要求高的病例可形成全国医疗体系的全周期服务。\n6. “临床-康复-护理”无缝衔接模式\n对于老年冠心病患者,临床、康复、护理是综合有机的整体,三者互相协作、补充,只有无缝衔接才能实现全周期地管理患者。在整个疾病过程中,三者需根据患者疾病的发展阶段不断调整各自的管理策略,真正做到以患者为中心。\n在临床方面,应加强冠心病的预防、药物管理、合并症的处理。康复则在临床诊疗的基础上，由康复医师进行评估及制定康复治疗计划,治疗师根据康复方案对患者进行个体化康复治疗,并及时讨论治疗过程中存在的问题,不断修订治疗计划。护理贯穿于临床和康复的整个过程，在协助诊疗、减轻痛苦、促进康复、提高医疗水平等方面发挥着重要作用。护理人员将康复的理念、技术层层传递,贯彻于医院、社区、居家康复各阶段。\n6.1 院内康复阶段\n除常规护理工作外,还需对患者进行健康教育,鼓励和支持患者设立短期和长期目标,并使用以问题为基础的健康教育模式,培养患者的自我管理能力,为社区阶段的康复提供基础。\n6.2 社区康复阶段\n社区康复主要面向老年稳定性冠心病患者,其康复目标是控制危险因素,预防急性冠状动脉综合征及心脏性猝死的发生,提高患者的治疗依从性。此阶段是院内康复阶段的延续和家庭康复阶段的基础,起着承上启下的枢纽作用,护理人员需对患者进行心理干预、戒烟教育等,促进患者改变不健康的生活方式,并帮助患者掌握有关心绞痛、心肌梗死等急性冠状动脉事件的急救知识,协助患者完成从医院到家庭的过渡。\n6.3 家庭康复阶段\n在家庭康复训练的过程中,家属的参与与督促至关重要。因此,护理人员需对患者及家属一体化健康教育,使患者及家属主观能动地参与到康复训练中,帮助患者适应家庭生活环境,以家庭一员的身份与其他家庭成员相处,使家庭康复成为康复医疗整体服务中的一个组成部分。同时,借助互联网医疗设施,开展定期、定时的远程康复指导与监测,为患者提供正确的康复理念及技术,对患者的康复效果及时反馈。\n7. 小结\n老年冠心病全周期康复采用多学科团队管理模式(即跨学科整合管理模式),通过疾病、人员、空间三个全周期干预,旨在为患者提供综合性的医疗、康复及护理服务。全周期康复通过持续的健康教育和随访系统,对老年冠心病患者进行长期的追踪,监督合理用药,调整生活方式,控制危险因素,指导科学运动,以提高冠心病治疗的安全性、有效性、依从性,提升自我管理能力,改善其心血管结局,提高生活质量。\n本共识专家组成员（按姓氏拼音顺序排列）：\n牵头专家：\n董安琴（郑州大学第五附属医院）\n执笔专家：\n陈作兵（浙江大学医院附属第一医院）\n陈

      "problem_en": "China Expert Consensus on Full-Cycle Rehabilitation for Elderly Coronary Heart Disease\n\nAuthor:\nAcademic Association[1]\n\nInstitution:\nAcademic Association[1]\n\nCoronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CHD) is one of the major health threats to the elderly (≥65 years), with prevalence increasing with age. In 1999, China had already entered the aging era. The 2020 seventh national census reported about 190 million people aged 65 and over, accounting for 13.50% of the population. Compared with the 2010 sixth census, the share of people aged 65 and over rose by 4.63 percentage points. The aging process is accelerating, making elderly health management an urgent priority.\nPopulation aging is one reason CHD incidence is rising; with global aging accelerating, China now has 16% of its population aged 60 and over, projected to reach 35% by 2050. CHD is a leading cause of death among the elderly aged 50–74 and those aged 75 and over, indicating numbers will rise rapidly. The main pathogenesis in the elderly CHD population is deterioration of lipid metabolism, leading to lipid deposition in the intima of normally smooth arteries. These lipids, carried by blood flow, gradually form atherosclerotic, white material, eventually causing obstruction or narrowing of the arterial lumen. CHD not only threatens the health of the elderly but also imposes a heavy burden on families and society.\nCHD development is influenced by multiple factors; since older adults commonly have hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and other comorbidities, the coronary arteries often show multivessel, diffuse, calcified, and chronic total occlusive lesions, increasing risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and mortality. Combining the China Cardiovascular Health and Disease Report 2020 and the 2015 China Health and Family Planning Statistical Yearbook, AMI mortality increases with age, starting at age 40, with an approximately exponential rise. Therefore, preventing and treating CHD in the elderly through cardiac rehabilitation has become a research focus: how to reduce recurrence of cardiovascular events and extend life expectancy through heart rehab.\n\nElderly CHD rehabilitation is a exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, supplemented by activities of daily living, cognitive, and psychosocial interventions, to slow or reverse disease progression and improve quality of life. The elderly CHD patient often has multiple comorbidities and multisystem decline, resulting in poor exercise tolerance and low rehab adherence. There are no established domestic guidelines specifically for elderly CHD rehabilitation yet. With support from the National Health Commission, led by the National Key R&D Program “Whole-Cycle Rehabilitation Technology System and Information Management for the Elderly (2018YFC2002300),” experts from rehabilitation and medical fields drafted this consensus to provide full-cycle rehabilitation assessment and treatment content from the CHD full-cycle rehabilitation and elderly comprehensive assessment perspectives, offering scientific guidance on safety and efficacy for rehabilitation professionals at different levels, and advancing China’s elderly CHD full-cycle rehabilitation work.\n\n1. Characteristics of elderly CHD patients\nCoronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart failure in the elderly. Elderly CHD patients commonly have degenerative changes in cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive systems; complication risks are higher; adaptability and functional reserve are reduced; muscle mass and quality decline; physical fitness and exercise capacity decrease; balance is poor; fall risk is high; and psychosocial issues are common. In addition, due to multiple underlying diseases, polypharmacy increases the risk of drug–drug interactions. These characteristics impose new requirements on rehabilitation for elderly CHD patients.\n\n2. Common functional impairments in elderly CHD patients\nThere is large inter-individual variation and complex disease in elderly CHD patients. In addition to cardiopulmonary and exercise function impairments, cognitive function, sleep disorders, and psychological issues may occur; a very small number may have sensory, continence, language, or swallowing disorders.\n\n2.1 Cardiac function impairment\nCHD is one of the most common causes of cardiac dysfunction. Myocardial ischemia/hypoxia, diffuse fibrous tissue proliferation, myocardial atrophy or loss, and even necrosis can impair myocardial diastole and systole, disrupt cardiac output, and reduce oxygen delivery capacity.\n\n2.2 Lung function impairment\nChronic cardiac dysfunction reduces tissue perfusion and cardiac ejection, causing pulmonary venous congestion and V/Q mismatch, affecting lung function. Prolonged bed rest after cardiac surgery increases risks of pulmonary infection, airway obstruction, or atelectasis. CHD patients have lower FVC, VC, FEV1, and DLCO than healthy individuals, indicating more pronounced lung function decline. Declines in FEV1 correlate with worse heart failure and with the severity of coronary stenosis. Studies show decreased pulmonary function is an independent risk factor for CHD, increasing CHD risk and cardiovascular mortality.\n\n2.3 Exercise capacity impairment\nAging and prolonged bed rest negatively affect cardiopulmonary function and physical fitness. During exercise, heart rate rises with workload, typically by about 10 bpm per 1 MET increase. Thus, elderly CHD patients are prone to tachyarrhythmias during exertion, limiting exercise capacity.\n\n2.4 Cognitive impairment\nCognitive impairment prevalence in elderly CHD patients ranges from 28% to 41.89%, mainly affecting memory, abstract thinking, and visuospatial/executive function. CHD is associated with gray matter loss in brain regions important for cognition and behavior. CHD can cause cerebral small vessel disease with ischemic neuronal changes and apoptosis, impairing cognition. CHD is associated with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). CHD is a risk factor for cognitive impairment across stages and subtypes.\n\n2.5 Mental health disorders\nElderly CHD patients have high rates of psychiatric disorders; anxiety and depression both predispose to CHD, and CHD and anxiety/depression are bidirectionally linked. People with CHD have higher prevalence and severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms than non-CHD populations. The CHD Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention Chinese Expert Consensus notes cardiovascular disease patients generally have mental health issues and advocates a bio-psycho-social service model.\n\n2.6 Sleep disorders\nSleep disorders are a common factor affecting elderly CHD. Sleep duration <6 hours/day or >9 hours/day are independent risk factors for CHD in healthy adults and are markers of depression in CHD patients.\n\n2.7 Social function impairment\nElderly CHD patients often experience social dysfunction due to decreased cardiopulmonary function, reduced physical function, and psychosocial stress, leading to withdrawal, home confinement, and reduced activity, which worsens psychosocial problems. Studies show early rehabilitation, full-cycle rehabilitation, and hospital-community health education management can improve mental health, social function, and quality of life.\n\n2.8 Daily activity participation impairment\nElderly CHD patients often have limited participation in activities of daily living (ADLs). Timely and accurate ADL assessment and guidance are key rehabilitation tasks. Based on the maximum MET from exercise testing, match daily activity MET values to the patient’s maximum MET to guide safe, appropriate daily activities.\n\n3. Comprehensive geriatric assessment\nOlder adults are a special group; multimorbidity and polypharmacy complicate CHD in the elderly. In addition to cardiopulmonary and exercise limitations, cognitive function, sleep, and psychosocial issues may be present. The American Geriatrics Society recommends focusing on frailty, cognition, depression, functional status, fall risk, nutrition, medication history, comorbidity, mental health, and social/environmental status. Research shows CHD, comorbidity, and geriatric syndromes interact to worsen disease burden, accelerate age-related functional decline, reduce quality of life, and increase health care use. Patients with geriatric syndromes have higher cardiovascular risk and poorer prognosis; these features impose new demands on elderly CHD rehabilitation. Therefore, geriatric-syndrome assessment should be integrated into treatment decisions and rehab planning to inform comprehensive prevention, treatment, and rehab. To promote improvement of function, quality of life, and healthy life expectancy, it is recommended to perform a holistic assessment based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework, combined with geriatric assessment content.\n\n3.1 General status and clinical evaluation\nIncludes systematic history, current medications, cardiopulmonary physical exam, imaging, labs, static cardiac function assessment, nutritional status, sarcopenia, frailty, fall risk assessment, etc. The ICFSR Special Working Group on Frailty recommends using simple, validated frailty tools suitable for the environment; the Chinese Association of Geriatrics and Gerontology recommends FRAIL scale for frailty screening in elderly CHD patients.\n\n3.2 Cardiac function assessment\nCommonly used methods include the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, Killip classification, Forrest hemodynamic class, Weber classification, and the 6-minute walk test. NYHA class examples: I – no limitation in ordinary activity; no symptoms with ordinary activity. II – ordinary activity results in fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea, or angina; comfortable at rest. III – marked limitation in activity; able to perform only less than ordinary activity; symptoms at rest. IV – cannot carry on any physical activity; symptoms of heart failure at rest; increasing with physical activity.\n\n3.3 Pulmonary function assessment\nClinical pulmonary function tests are used to assess lung volumes, ventilation, gas exchange, and small airways; smoking status may also be included. If dyspnea is present, the Borg Dyspnea Scale can be used.\n\n3.4 Exercise function assessment\n3.4.1 Exercise function assessment focuses on muscle strength, muscle endurance, balance, and flexibility (see Table 2).\n\n3.4.2 Exercise risk assessment\nBefore prescribing exercise, exercise risk assessment is required; exercise testing and risk stratification are key. Exercise testing includes instrumental tests and the 6-minute walk test. Instrumented tests typically use cycle or treadmill equipment and include electrocardiographic exercise testing and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); CPET is more accurate but requires higher operator proficiency. When performing tests, strict adherence to absolute/relative contraindications and termination criteria is essential; refer to the CHD Exercise Therapy China Expert Consensus for details.\n\n3.4.2.2 Risk stratification\nRisk stratification for exercise rehabilitation in elderly CHD follows the 1988 standards issued by the American College of Physicians’ Committee on Health Policy and Public Policy (see Table 3).\n\n3.5 Cognitive function assessment\nMoCA and MMSE are used for cognitive screening. MoCA covers broader cognitive domains and distinguishes healthy aging from MCI more accurately, making it suitable for screening elderly individuals for MCI.\n\n3.6 Mental health assessment\nIn cardiovascular populations, depression prevalence is 25–40%, higher than in healthy individuals. Depression increases all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular death. About a third of CHD patients may experience mental-stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). Therefore, geriatric assessment should include psychological evaluation; common scales include the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Geriatric Depression Scale.\n\n3.7 Activities of daily living assessment\nADLs are divided into basic ADLs (BADL) and instrumental ADLs (IADL). Evaluations can use interviews, observation, and scales. BADL is assessed with the Barthel Index or Modified Barthel Index and the Functional Independence Measure. IADL assessments typically use the Social Functioning Questionnaire and the Lawton-Brody IADL Scale.\n\n3.8 Environmental assessment\nEnvironmental-factor assessment for elderly CHD includes living environment, public environment, and communication environment. Home safety assessment is emphasized to prevent falls; tools include the Comprehensive Home Environment Assessment and Modification, Home Fall and Injury Screening Tool, Home Environment Checklist, Functional and Rehabilitation Environment Safety Assessment, and Home Safety Quick Assessment, typically conducted before discharge planning.\n\n4. Rehabilitation for common functional impairments in elderly CHD\nRehabilitation content for common deficits includes cardiopulmonary function rehabilitation, psychological rehabilitation, and cognitive rehabilitation.\n\n4.1 Cardiac function rehabilitation\n4.1.1 Exercise rehabilitation\nStudies show that CHD patients over 65 undergoing exercise rehabilitation improve metabolic indicators, cardiac function, and exercise capacity, with benefits lasting about 12 months. A dose–response relationship exists between rehab frequency and cardiac function improvements. Experts advocate risk-stratified exercise prescriptions: low-risk patients may exercise without supervision, moderate-risk require close monitoring during activity, and high-risk require cautious prescribing.\n\n4.1.2 Extracorporeal cardiac shockwave therapy\nExtracorporeal shockwave therapy (SWT) targets coronary microvascular revascularization, effectively treating refractory angina, improving symptoms and quality of life, enhancing exercise tolerance in heart failure, and may be an important supplement to CHD treatment strategies.\n\n4.1.3 External counterpulsation (ECP)\nECP's double-pulsatile flow increases shear stress on vessel walls, protects endothelial function, reduces inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules, delaying atherosclerosis progression. ECP shows good clinical efficacy and safety and can be a noninvasive adjunct in elderly CHD rehab.\n\n4.1.4 Traditional Chinese medicine rehabilitation\nTraditional Chinese practices (e.g., Tai Chi, Baduanjin, Qigong) are increasingly recognized for elderly CHD rehab, particularly suitable for intermediate-to-high risk or low exercise capacity patients. Chinese herbal dietary therapy is also incorporated as an adjunct to rehabilitation.\n\n4.2 Pulmonary function rehabilitation\n4.2.1 Smoking cessation education\nDuring evaluation of elderly CHD patients, actively inquire about active and passive smoking. Provide clear guidance to quit smoking, offer cessation counseling, and develop a quitting plan. Use nicotine dependence scales to assess dependence; for higher dependence, combine pharmacotherapy with behavioral interventions to improve cessation success.\n\n4.2.2 Breathing training\nBreathing programs may include aerobic training, inspiratory muscle training, pursed-lip breathing, deep breathing, diaphragmatic breathing, and computer-assisted respiratory feedback. Active breathing cycle techniques can help clear bronchial secretions and improve lung function.\n\n4.3 Mental health rehabilitation\nFor elderly CHD patients with severe anxiety or depression, refer to psychiatric specialists; for moderate to mild anxiety/depression, especially with somatic symptoms, treat with psychological interventions, relaxation training, music therapy, health education, exercise rehabilitation, and antidepressants as indicated.\n\n4.4 Cognitive rehabilitation\nInterventions for cognitive impairment may include one-to-one desk-based training, scenario-based training, cognitive games, and virtual reality.\n\n4.5 Health education\nThe in-hospital rehab period is most conducive to health education. Use this time to explain disease factors, reduce relapse, disseminate CHD knowledge, reduce anxiety, control risk factors, and improve medication adherence. Promote healthy lifestyle changes (balanced diet, evidence-based exercise, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, weight management, sleep management, etc.).\n\n5. Full-cycle rehabilitation for elderly CHD\nFull-cycle management of elderly CHD is a comprehensive cardiovascular disease management model, incorporating biopsychosocial health care including exercise therapy. It includes three dimensions: disease lifecycle, participant lifecycle, and spatial lifecycle (see Figure 1). This model informs CHD care at different levels, supports hierarchical medical care, defines workforce roles, and helps reduce regional resource disparities. Full-cycle rehabilitation helps clinicians understand rehabilitation stages and deliver targeted therapy to optimize functional prognosis.\n\n5.1 Disease lifecycle\nThe elderly CHD full cycle encompasses etiologic prevention, preclinical clinical prevention, and tertiary prevention, and should use cardiopulmonary exercise testing for health and subclinical management of at-risk elderly populations to achieve prevention at the pre-disease “zero level.” For high-risk elderly populations, manage factors such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking, and closely monitor health indicators for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment. In line with the 2018 Essentials of CHD Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention Guidelines and the ACC/AHA CHD Rehabilitation quality-control report, diagnosed elderly CHD patients should receive a three-tier rehabilitation across the full cycle: in-hospital rehabilitation, early outpatient/clinic rehabilitation, and long-term outpatient rehabilitation.\n\n5.1.1 Phase I cardiac rehabilitation (in-hospital rehabilitation)\nProvides rehab and prevention services during the acute hospital phase. Phase I aims to shorten hospital stay, restore ADLs and physical capacity, boost confidence, reduce psychological burden, lower readmission, prevent bed-rest complications, and guide smoking cessation, providing complete information for Phase II. Main contents include early comprehensive condition assessment, self-management training, lifestyle modification guidance (smoking/alcohol, diet, exercise, sleep), and evidence-based pharmacotherapy (individualized drug selection and dosing, risk factor control, and adherence). See Table 4 for in-hospital assessment content, physical activity, exercise guidance, and health education, plus indications/contraindications.\n\nIt is crucial that Phase I exercise and ADL guidance occur under ECG and blood pressure monitoring (e.g., supine to seated, seated to standing, standing to walking). If no adverse reactions occur, progressively increase activity to tolerable levels; if adverse reactions occur, stop and restart at one level lower, gradually increasing intensity. Phase I exercise rehab and ADL guidance follow the CHD Exercise Therapy Chinese Expert Consensus. A pre-discharge exercise risk assessment should be conducted to guide post-discharge activity and provide discharge exercise prescriptions or Phase II rehab recommendations.\n\n5.1.2 Phase II cardiac rehabilitation (outpatient early rehab or clinic rehab)\nTypically conducted 1–6 months post-discharge, commonly 2–5 weeks after PCI or CABG. Contents include comprehensive assessment, risk stratification, evidence-based pharmacotherapy, risk factor control, lifestyle modification, with exercise prescription, nutrition prescription, smoking cessation prescription, and psychological prescription. This period uses an individualized case-management approach, setting personalized risk factor intervention goals with patient-centered shared short- and long-term goals. The approach balances overall risk factor intervention with individualized tailoring, considering patient preferences and capacity. Phase II is a continuation of Phase I and a foundation for Phase III; see Table 5 for indications and contraindications.\n\n5.1.3 Phase III cardiac rehabilitation (outpatient long-term rehab)\nFor patients one year post-cardiovascular event, providing prevention and rehab services as a continuation of Phase II. Some patients resume daily activities/work; the key is to maintain established healthy lifestyle and exercise habits, continue to correct cardiovascular risk factors, and strengthen psychosocial support. Exercise guidance should be individualized: low-risk patients may rehab without medical supervision; intermediate/high-risk patients may still require medical supervision. Therefore, ongoing follow-up and risk-stratification assessment are essential. Low-risk and some intermediate-low-risk patients may progress to Phase III; high-risk and some intermediate-high-risk patients should transfer to higher-level hospitals for continuing rehab.\n\n5.2 Lifecycle of participants\nElderly CHD rehab staff include cardiologists, cardiac rehabilitation specialists, rehabilitation therapists, specialized nurses, nutritionists, psychologists, social workers, and patient families. Cardiologists manage medications; rehab physicians perform comprehensive assessments, risk control, and rehab planning. Rehab therapists handle physical therapy and occupational therapy. After sternotomy, ventilator-dependent, or in cases of systemic failure or diaphragmatic weakness, rehab therapists provide specialized cardiopulmonary therapy and respiratory training. Cardiac rehab nurses establish patient records, document assessments, monitor and guide the continuation of ADLs in hospital. Social workers and families are central to community and home rehab and are key components of the full-cycle model. In the full-cycle model, therapists can provide remote rehab guidance via cloud-based communication, enabling real-time home rehab guidance, monitoring exercise intensity and cardiopulmonary changes, and providing timely feedback to improve home/community rehab engagement and self-management.\n\n5.3 Spatial lifecycle\nSpatial lifecycle covers risk-factor control before onset, clinical management at onset, and hospital, community, and home rehabilitation stages after onset. Full-cycle rehab for elderly CHD requires cooperation among all levels of medical institutions. Given regional differences in living standards, geography, medical levels, and treatment models, regions can tailor rehab systems and service processes. For complex, high-skill cases, nationwide full-cycle services can be formed.\n\n6. Seamless integration of “Clinical–Rehab–Nursing”\nFor elderly CHD patients, clinical care, rehabilitation, and nursing are an integrated, dynamic whole; collaboration and mutual supplementation are essential for full-cycle management. Throughout the disease course, these three components should continuously adjust management strategies according to disease progression, keeping the patient at the center.\nClinically, strengthen CHD prevention, pharmacologic management, and comorbidity handling. Rehabilitation, based on clinical care, is planned by rehab physicians who assess and prescribe rehab plans; therapists deliver individualized rehab per plan and promptly discuss problems, continuously revising the plan. Nursing spans the entire clinical and rehab process, contributing to diagnosis/treatment support, pain relief, rehabilitation promotion, and care quality improvement. Nursing staff propagate rehab concepts and techniques across hospital, community, and home rehab stages.\n\n6.1 In-hospital rehabilitation phase\nBesides routine nursing, provide health education, encourage and support goal setting (short- and long-term), and use problem-based health education to foster self-management, laying groundwork for community-stage rehab.\n\n6.2 Community rehabilitation phase\nCommunity rehab targets elderly stable CHD patients; goals are risk-factor control, prevention of acute coronary syndromes and cardiac death, and improving treatment adherence. This phase extends in-hospital rehab and forms the basis for home rehab; it serves as a bridge. Nurses should provide psychological support, smoking-cessation education, promote lifestyle changes, and help patients acquire emergency knowledge for acute coronary events (e.g., angina, myocardial infarction) to facilitate the hospital-to-home transition.\n\n6.3 Home rehabilitation phase\nFamily involvement and supervision are crucial. Therefore, nurses should provide integrated health education for patients and families to enable active participation in rehab, help patients adapt to the home environment, and function as part of the family while integrating rehab into the family setting. Leveraging telemedicine, conduct regular remote rehab guidance and monitoring, supply correct rehab concepts and techniques, and provide timely feedback on rehab outcomes.\n\n7. Summary\nElderly CHD full-cycle rehabilitation uses a multidisciplinary team management model (i.e., interdisciplinary integrated management). Through disease, personnel, and space full-cycle interventions, it aims to deliver comprehensive medical, rehab, and nursing services. Full-cycle rehab emphasizes ongoing health education and follow-up systems to track patients long-term, supervise rational medication use, adjust lifestyles, manage risk factors, and guide evidence-based exercise to improve safety, effectiveness, and adherence of CHD treatment, enhance self-management, improve cardiovascular outcomes, and raise quality of life.\n\nExpert panel (ordered by pinyin surname):\nLead expert:\nDong Anqin (The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University)\n\nWriting experts:\nChen Zuobing (First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine)\nChen Xin (China-Japan Friendship Hospital)\nDong Anqin (The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University)\nDing Yupeng (Hainan General Hospital)\nHe Jing (West China Hospital, Sichuan University)\nJia Jie (Huashan Hospital, Fudan University)\nLiao Weijing (Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University)\nYe Xujun (Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University)\nYu Hui (The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University)\nYao Liqing (Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University)\nZheng Jiejiao (East China Hospital, Fudan University)\nZhou Xue (The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University)\n\nSecretaries:\nZhou Xue, Yu Hui\n\nReferences: omitted",

DOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn101411-20231220-00055.\n基金项目：国家自然科学基金（82170493，82270507）\n胸主动脉疾病是一个重要的公共卫生问题。近年来，随着医务人员对主动脉疾病认识的提高，以及影像学诊断、手术技术和麻醉技术的进步，胸降主动脉瘤（descending thoracic aortic aneurysm， DTAA）的诊出率不断提高，手术并发症发生率及死亡率明显下降。但由于目前国际上仍缺乏关于DTAA治疗的大规模前瞻性随机对照试验（randomized controlled trial， RCT）研究，业内对于该疾病的诊断和治疗仍存在诸多争议。\n为规范和指导主动脉疾病的临床诊疗，欧洲血管外科学会（European Society for Vascular Surgery，ESVS）于2017年发布了胸降主动脉（descending thoracic aorta， DTA）疾病治疗的指南［1-2］；美国血管外科协会（Society for Vascular Surgery，SVS）于2020年发布了DTAA腔内修复指南，对该指南先前的版本进行了较多的更新和修改［3］。上述 指南对DTAA的诊断、治疗及随访作出了相应的推荐。目前，我国DTAA的诊疗也基本沿用上述指南，但国内尚无系统的DTAA诊疗规范。\n鉴于此，依托中华医学会外科学分会血管外科学组，学组组织国内部分专家根据新临床研究成果，特别是基于中国患者的临床研究，参考国际相关协会组织发布的指南和共识，并结合我国国情及临床实践，对DTAA的诊疗制定共识，对其诊疗原则进行推荐，为医疗决策提供指导与参考。\n一、解剖学、定义和分型\n（一）解剖学\n主动脉可分为11个区，用于描述主动脉的节段及在腔内修复过程中可能被覆盖或替换的分支。有6个区位于胸主动脉，其中3~5区位于DTA［4］。3区为左锁骨下动脉开口远端至左锁骨下动脉开口以远2 cm处，为近端DTA；4区为左锁骨下动脉开口以远2 cm处至DTA中点（约T6水平），为DTA直行部分；5区为DTA中点（约T6水平）至腹腔干开口近端，为远端DTA。见图1。\n（二）定义\n主动脉瘤的定义为主动脉因各种原因导致的节段性扩张，其直径大于相邻正常主动脉的1.5倍［5-7］。发生在DTA区域的主动脉瘤即DTAA。鉴于动脉瘤的直径与DTAA增长速度和破裂风险密切相关，因而动脉瘤的直径对DTAA的诊断、治疗及预后有着重要意义［8-9］。\n（三）分型\n目前，尚无公认的关于DTAA的分型方法。可根据动脉瘤累及的区域进行分型；也可根据动脉瘤的形态，将DTAA分为梭形DTAA和囊状DTAA，囊状动脉瘤可能是斑块出血、主动脉溃疡或主动脉壁感染的表现［10-11］。\n二、流行病学\n目前，国内尚缺乏基于人群的DTAA流行病学数据。有研究结果显示，欧美国家DTAA和胸腹主动脉瘤的年发病率为6~10/10万。所有胸主动脉瘤中，DTAA约占35%，升主动脉瘤约占40%，主动脉弓动脉瘤约占15%，胸腹主动脉瘤约占10%［12］。\n近年来，胸主动脉疾病的患病率和发病率高于先前报道，且持续上升。DTAA患病率的上升归因于诸多方面，包括影像学技术的发展、人口老龄化以及患者和医生意识的提高等。\nDTAA多见于老年人。胸主动脉瘤患者确诊时的平均年龄为65岁，男女比例为1.7∶1［13］。DTAA明显与遗传因素有关，20%以上的患者受一级亲属动脉瘤疾病的影响［14］。\n三、病因和危险因素\n大部分DTAA属于退行性病变，与动脉粥样硬化危险因素相关。其他致病因素包括系统性自身免疫疾病、主动脉感染及结缔组织病（如Marfan综合征、Loeys-Dietz综合征和Ehlers-Danlos综合征）等［15-16］。\n1.动脉粥样硬化：大多数DTAA是退行性病变，并与动脉粥样硬化的危险因素有关，如吸烟、高血压和高胆固醇血症，但尚不明确动脉粥样硬化在动脉瘤形成中的作用。高血压是重要的危险因素，见于60%以上的DTAA患者。\n2.炎症性疾病：多种炎症性疾病都可导致DTAA，包括巨细胞动脉炎、大动脉炎、类风湿关节炎、强直性脊柱炎、肉芽肿性多血管炎及反应性关节炎。巨细胞动脉炎是最常导致胸主动脉瘤的炎症性疾病。多达11%的巨细胞动脉炎患者发生DTAA或相关胸主动脉疾病［12］。\n3.遗传性结缔组织病：最常见的是Marfan综合征、Loeys-Dietz综合征和Ehlers-Danlos综合征。遗传性结缔组织病主动脉扩张的速度比退行性动脉瘤更快，需要干预的可能性也更大。此外，对于存在遗传性结缔组织病的患者，若首次主动脉手术是治疗A型主动脉夹层，术后主动脉远端残余的慢性夹层进展为主动脉瘤的风险极高，术后必须随访。\n4.既往主动脉夹层病史：急性主动脉夹层常累及升主和降主动脉。无需立即手术的急性主动脉夹层存活患者可出现动脉瘤样改变，导致主动脉进行性扩张和迟发主动脉破裂。\n5.创伤：胸部创伤可能因减速力导致主动脉峡部的假性DTAA。\n6.感染：导致DTAA的主动脉感染可源于细菌直接侵袭、菌血症播种及邻近部位感染。感染可削弱动脉壁成分，导致动脉瘤迅速形成。此类动脉瘤通常伴有穿透主动脉溃疡，且常为囊状动脉瘤。\n7.解剖变异：一些解剖变异具有高DTAA发病风险，如二叶式主动脉瓣、主动脉缩窄（婴幼儿时期行主动脉缩窄手术）及Kommerell憩室等。\n四、诊断\n（一）病史\n临床病史可评估DTAA患者的风险程度，如高血压病史及血压控制情况、重要药物使用史、结缔组织病史、血管炎病史、主动脉手术史和胸部外伤史等。此外，应详细采集家族史及家族性动脉瘤和夹层史。\n （二）临床表现\n除非并发夹层、动脉瘤破裂等出现疼痛，DTAA通常无症状，多在体检或其他疾病诊疗中检出［17］。DTAA并发夹层可表现为器官灌注不良或神经系统并发症等。DTAA破裂可有失血性休克的表现，包括神志淡漠或昏迷、皮肤苍白、心动过速、呼吸急促、尿少及血压下降等。DTAA破裂可进入相邻的食管或支气管，造成主动脉-食管瘘或主动脉-支气管瘘，表现为呕血或咯血。巨大DTAA会压迫食管造成吞咽困难，压迫左侧喉返神经或左侧迷走神经造成声音嘶哑，压迫膈神经造成单侧膈肌麻痹［18］。如果气管、支气管受压，则会出现哮鸣音、咳嗽、咯血、呼吸困难或肺炎。中心静脉或上腔静脉受压可导致血栓栓塞或上腔静脉闭塞引起的上腔静脉综合征（颈部、面部或上肢出现肿胀）。DTAA可能侵蚀毗邻的脊柱从而导致背痛。\n（三）实验室检查\nDTAA患者的初步实验室检查包括血常规、肝肾功能、电解质、出凝血、D-二聚体和心肌标志物。这些实验室检查可能有助于指导DTAA患者的治疗。对于有全身性表现（如发热、体重减轻）的患者，白细胞计数升高可能提示主动脉感染或炎症，D-二聚体升高可能提示瘤体巨大［19-20］。贫血可能提示休克由急性失血所致，乳酸水平升高有助于评估缺血严重程度。\n（四）影像学检查\n1.胸片：DTAA可改变纵隔的横径，使患者的胸片表现为纵隔增宽。另外DTAA患者的胸片还可表现为主动脉轮廓消失、气管偏斜、支气管凹陷及动脉瘤破裂导致的胸腔积液等［21］。但胸片在DTAA诊断中常容易出现误诊。\n2.计算机断层扫描血管造影（computed tomography angiography，CTA）：目前，CTA是可疑DTAA患者的优选影像学检查方法，具有普及性广、采集快速、敏感度和特异度高、空间分辨率高及多种后处理方式等优势。如果计划行胸主动脉腔内修复术（thoracic endovascular aortic repair， TEVAR），建议使用层厚≤0.25 mm的CTA对全主动脉进行成像，采集范围从胸廓入口至耻骨联合水平，上至弓上三分支，下至双侧股动脉［22］。建议采用64排以上心电门控CT扫描，以减少心脏和主动脉搏动所致的伪影。注意静脉造影剂的用量和注射速率以减少左头臂静脉和上腔静脉增强影对主动脉的干扰。多角度多平面三维重建有利于评估主动脉的形态，基于中心线的直径测量更为准确［23-25］。\n3.MRI：考虑到CTA普及性广、采集快速及空间分辨率高等优势，MRI不作为DTAA的常规检查。对于碘过敏、甲状腺功能亢进、肾功能不全、妊娠期妇女（妊娠早期3个月）或其他CTA相对或绝对禁忌证的患者，MRI是优选的替代检查手段。MRI对DTAA的诊断效率与CTA相似。相较于CTA，MRI具有更强的软组织分辨力，可定性或量化功能参数。对于合并血管炎的患者，MRI能够提供更好的管壁成像。但是，MRI扫描时间长，不适用于循环不稳定的急症患者。此外，对于体内有生命辅助装置或磁性金属植入物，存在幽闭恐惧症的患者亦不适用。MRI另一个优势为可在不接受碘造影剂或辐射的情况下提供主动脉形态学和血流参数。\n4.超声心动图：经胸超声心动图（transthoracic echocardiography，TTE）具有较好的便携性和普及性，可同时评估患者的心功能、主动脉瓣和主动脉窦的情况。TTE诊断DTAA的准确率低于CT或MRI。此外，TTE受限于患者的胸壁形态、肋间隙宽度、肥胖、肺气肿及机械通气等，而经食管超声心动图（transesophageal echocardiography，TEE）可克服这些问题，明显提高诊断的准确率。但是，作为一种侵入性检查，TEE对DTAA患者具有一定的风险，不建议在非全身麻醉状态下实施。\n5.血管腔内超声：可实时、动态地显示主动脉腔内的三维结构，可作为胸主动脉病变腔内治疗的重要辅助手段。血管腔内超声的使用可减少术中造影剂的用量和放射线的使用，为DTAA的治疗提供重要价值。建议TEVAR术中使用血管腔内超声来评估DTAA的远端着陆区，详细评估远端着陆区或重要分支血管起源。\n五、治疗\n（一）围术期管理\nDTAA患者的围术期管理包括控制血压、调节血脂和戒烟。\n1.控制血压：使用降压药物是主动脉病变患者的一线治疗方案。血压控制主要通过降低左心室收缩力和收缩速率来实现，从而减小主动脉壁应力，这对于有症状的动脉瘤和急性主动脉综合征患者尤为重要。治疗的目标是在TEVAR围术期尽可能将收缩压降至120 mmHg（1 mmHg=0.133 kPa）以下，并将心率降至60～80次/min。静脉注射β受体阻滞剂（或α/β受体阻滞剂）为控制血压的一线治疗药物。对于β受体阻滞剂不耐受的患者，钙通道阻滞剂和/或血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂/阻滞剂可用作替代疗法或补充剂［26］。由于高血压是主动脉瘤发展的相关危险因素，且与主动脉的加速增大和破裂有关，建议按照美国心脏病协会/美国心脏学会指南进行血压管理［27］。\n2.调节血脂：对于血脂异常的DTAA患者，应使用他汀类药物将低密度脂蛋白胆固醇水平控制在小于70 mg/dl的水平，可能有助于控制动脉瘤的进展［28］。\n3.戒烟：建议DTAA患者戒烟及避免二手烟，减少主动脉破裂的风险［29-30］。\n（二）开放手术\n目前，尚无前瞻性RCT研究来比较开放手术和TEVAR对DTAA治疗的临床效果。在对胸主动脉瘤的报道中，行开放手术的围术期发病率和死亡率的风险仍较高。在部分高度专业化的临床中心，开放手术治疗破裂胸主动脉瘤后的死亡率接近26%［31］。相比之下，美国胸主动脉瘤择期开放手术的总体死亡率约为22%［32］。另外，部分临床中心报告了极低的开放手术后死亡率和脊髓缺血发生率，分别为4.8%和4.6%［33］。然而，大量研究一致证明，对于孤立的胸主动脉瘤来说，TEVAR是开放手术的安全替代方案，显著降低患者的并发症发生率和死亡率，并缩短住院时间［34-35］。一项综述比较了开放手术和TEVAR在胸主动脉瘤中的应用，结果显示TEVAR在技术上是可行的，通过非随机研究显示其早期不良结局（如截瘫、死亡率和住院时间）有所减少，但仍需高质量的RCT研究对其进一步验证［36-37］。因此，对于开放手术和TEVAR这两种方法均适用的DTAA患者，建议TEVAR 作为择期治疗DTAA的优选方法，因其降低了并发症发生率和近期死亡率，并且缩短了治疗时间和住院时间。\n（三）TEVAR\n1.手术指征：直径为6.0 cm的胸主动脉瘤未经治疗的5年生存率为54%，破裂风险为3.7%/年，死亡风险为12.0%/年［38-39］。纳入超过1 600例胸主动脉瘤和主动脉夹层患者的前瞻性数据库发现，DTAA年平均增长直径为0.10 cm［40］。在破裂风险较高的囊状动脉瘤中，TEVAR可在动脉瘤直径小于6.0 cm时进行。对于主动脉解剖情况良好的“低风险”无症状DTAA患者，当其动脉瘤最 大直径超过5.5 cm时，建议行TEVAR治疗。而对于存在死亡、肾功能衰竭及截瘫高风险的DTAA患者，建议对TEVAR使用更高的主动脉直径阈值，因为这些患者的治疗收益低于动脉瘤自然病程带来的风险。对于使用TEVAR来治疗感染性主动脉疾病，目前尚缺乏令人信服的长期数据。尽管TEVAR在用于临时处理破裂的感染性胸主动脉瘤或合并主动脉-食管瘘/主动脉-支气管瘘时可能是有效的，但该部分患者的并发症发生率和死亡率都很高。因此，对于有症状的感染性DTAA，建议TEVAR作为临时的治疗措施，但目前尚缺乏长期获益的数据。\n2.术中肾脏保护策略：住院期间或TEVAR术后发生的急性肾损伤（acute kidney injury， AKI）是预测死亡率的最重要风险因素之一，尤其是当AKI进展至需要透析时。当TEVAR术后发生AKI（发生率为10%～15%），即使不需要透析，死亡率也会增高10倍［41-42］。术后AKI的危险因素包括高龄、慢性肾功能衰竭、糖尿病、充血性心力衰竭、失血、大手术及与腔内操作相关的动脉栓塞。重要的是，造影剂肾病是住院患者AKI的第三大原因，其发生率为5%～25%。造影剂肾病的风险因素包括年龄、糖尿病、既往肾脏疾病和过高的造影剂剂量［43-44］。因此，建议在TEVAR术前进行手术规划，包括支架及支架锚定区的尺寸，以尽量减少含碘造影剂的使用。如果可行，应在术中使用CTA导航技术和腔内超声技术，以尽量减少造影剂的使用。建议使用非离子低渗造影剂，特别是对于造影剂肾病风险高的患者。建议在可能的情况下稀释高压注射器中的含碘造影剂（通常稀释到50%或70%）。建议使用数字减影血管造影设备术中绘图软件，如路图、CT融合或导航等技术，以帮助定位锚定区，减少重复造影。\n3.术中操作策略：高危DTAA患者TEVAR术中，可在主动脉分支中预置导丝、导管或鞘管来标记目标分支的位置，从而较大限度地减少重复造影。为减少动脉斑块脱落导致的栓塞，建议TEVAR术中避免对主动脉弓部及内脏动脉区进行不必要的操作。为避免脊髓缺血和下肢缺血的发生，推荐减少经股动脉大鞘的留置时间。当需要长时间留置时，推荐将大鞘头端退至髂外动脉，使得同侧髂内动脉可以提供侧支的供血［3］。\n4.TEVAR的入路：尽管随着支架输送系统的润滑性增加和外径减小，TEVAR的入路并发症正在不断减少，但是入路相关问题仍然是TEVAR术后并发症的常见来源。一些辅助措施可应用于髂动脉管经较小的患者入路，包括使用更近端的动脉及开放手术等［35，45］。\n（1）股动脉入路：经皮股总动脉穿刺是TEVAR常见的入路方式。目前已有多种可识别股动脉的技术，例如横向小切口建立入路和超声引导，成功率为92%~96%［46-47］。在大多数中心，超声引导已成为经皮建立血管通路的常规方法，因其有助于操作者识别和避免可能导致血管闭合失败的解剖因素，例如穿过腹股沟韧带或动脉前壁上的钙化。一项Meta分析结果显示，在469 次TEVAR经皮建立股动脉通路中，总体成功率为94%，腹股沟并发症发生率为3.6%，只有1.6%的患者需要开腹行腹股沟开放修复术。最常见的并发症是腹股沟血肿（1.8%），其次是假性动脉瘤（0.7%）。提高经皮穿刺成功率的因素包括超声引导和鞘管尺寸小于20 F。其他能提高经皮入路成功率的解剖学因素包括穿刺处股动脉直径大于1 cm且没有前壁钙化，腹股沟无严重瘢痕，自体动脉通路及入路血管直径大于5 mm［48］。\n股动脉切开是另一种TEVAR常见的入路方式，通过在腹股沟韧带水平切开、暴露股总动脉并控制股动脉近远端。腹股沟横行或斜行切口，因切口相关并发症更少而优于垂直切口，垂直切口术后的相关并发症发生率高达18%［49］。\n因此，如通过股动脉穿刺的方式建立TEVAR入路，建议超声引导下穿刺以减少并发症的发生。如股动脉直径合适且前壁无明显钙化，建议使用穿刺替代切开建立股动脉TEVAR入路。如通过切开的方式建立TEVAR股动脉入路，建议使用横行或斜行切口。\n（2）其他入路：除常规的股动脉入路外，TEVAR也可通过髂动脉、主动脉、颈动脉-腋窝等入路方式［50］。如髂外动脉或股动脉重度狭窄、闭塞或钙化严重，建议可选用腹膜外入路，经髂动脉旁路或穿刺髂动脉的方式植入主动脉支架。在经股动脉或髂动脉入路不可用的情况下，可选择头臂动脉入路的方式进行TEVAR装置的输送。\n（四）有症状和破裂DTAA的治疗\n一项瑞典的研究结果显示，破裂DTAA开放手术的早期死亡率很高，住院死亡率接近100%，TEVAR的结果则更为乐观［51］。基于Medicare数据库结果显示，破裂DTAA患者接受TEVAR治疗的比例从2004年的17%增加到了2007年的49%，死亡率从开放手术的45%降至TEVAR的24%［52］。相较于开放手术，TEVAR治疗破裂DTAA还有其他优势。相关研究显示，与开放手术相比，TEVAR围术期心肌梗死的发生率显著降低［53］。此外，TEVAR术后15年内卒中、截瘫和死亡的发生率低于开放手术［54］。因此，对于解剖条件合适的患者，建议通过TEVAR替代开放手术治疗破裂DTAA。\n六、随访管理\nDTAA患者无论采用何种治疗方式，均需进行长期乃至终身的规律随访，以观察内漏、支架移位及动脉瘤扩张等并发症是否发生或进展。如无禁忌，影像学随访应选CTA。目前，影像学随访的频率尚无统一标准，最常用的随访方案为TEVAR术后1、6、12个月，及以后每年1次影像学随访［55-56］。对于持续稳定时间5年以上的患者，可适当放宽至2～3年随访1次。对于急诊行TEVAR的DTAA患者，需在住院期间或术后1周内进行CTA检查［57］。如在随访期间发现内漏或其他异常，应考虑更频繁的影像学检查。对于存在CTA禁忌证的患者，可考虑行MRI随访。\n\n请总结一下上述共识的重点内容，总共字数不超过200字。",

      "problem": "一、定义和概述\n食管阻塞是指动物食管内部被异物或其他物质所堵塞，导致食物和液体无法顺利通过到达胃部。这种情况可能发生在多种动物身上，包括狗、猫、鸟类以及农场动物如马、牛等。食管是连接口腔和胃部的管道，其主要功能是将进食的物质顺利输送到胃内进行消化。当食管发生阻塞时，会导致正常的进食和饮水过程受到影响，严重时可能危及动物的生命。\n二、食管阻塞的影响\n食管阻塞对动物健康的危害不容忽视，这种状况的影响体现在多个方面。食管阻塞使得食物无法顺利到达胃部进行消化，导致动物难以获取必需的营养和能量，长期下来会引起体重下降、营养不良乃至营养性疾病。同时，阻塞还可能干扰动物的饮水能力，造成脱水或电解质失衡，这对身体机能产生负面影响。在一些严重的情况下，堵塞物可能压迫附近的气管或诱发肺部感染，从而引起呼吸困难和其他呼吸系统相关的问题。阻塞还会导致食物在食管内堆积，给动物带来疼痛和不适，尤其是在进食过程中。长期的食管阻塞还可能导致食管黏膜发炎、形成溃疡，甚至出现食管壁穿孔等更为严重的并发症。因此，及时识别和处理食管阻塞对于保障动物的健康至关重要。有效的预防措施和正确的治疗方法能够减少动物遭受的痛苦，并提高治愈率和康复速度。\n三、食管阻塞的原因\n食管阻塞是动物健康中的常见问题，其原因多种多样，涵盖了不同动物种类和生活环境。以下是一些主要的食管阻塞原因及其相关的风险因素和引发条件：\n不同动物可能的食管阻塞原因\n（一）异物吞咽\n异物吞咽是多种动物常见的问题，狗和猫常常会误食小型玩具、骨头碎片、绳索、塑料袋等异物，尤其在狗狗爱啃咬、猫咪好奇玩耍的情况下；鸟类则容易吞食饲料中的硬质物或小颗粒，如种子壳、玩具部件等；而农场动物，如牛、马，在进食时也可能误吞塑料包装、铁钉、绳索等。\n（二）食物阻塞\n食物阻塞可能由多种因素引起，包括胃肠道不良，如食管狭窄或食管炎症导致食物无法顺利通过食管；喂食不当，例如喂食过大块的食物或过硬的食物，容易引发食管阻塞；病理性原因，如某些神经性疾病会影响动物的进食能力和食管的运动功能，增加食管阻塞的风险；此外，动物体内肿瘤或其他异物压迫食管也会造成阻塞。\n（三）主要的风险因素和引发条件\n主要的风险因素和引发条件包括年龄和品种，年幼的动物因好奇心强而更易误食异物，而老年动物由于牙齿问题或消化系统功能减弱，也更易发生食管阻塞；环境和饲养条件，如饲养环境中存在的未处理垃圾、易碎物品等不安全因素，增加了动物误食异物的风险，长时间饲养在粗糙地面上的动物容易吞食泥土或石头；消化系统疾病，如消化道疾病、食管炎症等，会降低食管的通畅性，增加食管阻塞的可能性；饮食习惯，动物食用未经充分咀嚼的大块食物或过硬的食物，特别是在咀嚼能力较弱的情况下，也容易导致食管阻塞。\n小贴士：\n养殖主应定期检查动物的生活环境，移除可能被误食的小物件和危险物质，同时提供适宜的食物和喂养方式，特别是对年幼、老年或有特定健康问题的动物给予额外关注。\n四、症状和临床表现\n食管阻塞是动物常见的急性医疗问题，其症状和临床表现因动物种类和具体情况而异。以下是不同动物在食管阻塞时可能出现的症状，以及如何识别和分辨这些症状的临床表现：\n（一）牛、羊、猪、马等常见家畜\n牛、猪、马、羊等家畜在遭遇食管阻塞时，可能会表现出咀嚼时的痛苦或困难，食欲显著减退，同时因食管阻塞刺激胃部和食管，导致反复打嗝或流出大量唾液。长期的阻塞还可能导致动物消化不良和营养缺乏，进而出现体温升高和体重减轻等症状。\n\n\n图1-1 牛食道阻塞 （刘铁忠 兽医内科学）\n（二）狗和猫\n狗和猫在遭遇食管阻塞时，可能会频繁呕吐，吐出的是黏稠的胃酸和部分未消化的食物。在尝试进食时，它们可能表现出咀嚼困难或完全拒绝进食，食管阻塞刺激唾液分泌增加，导致流口水。狗和猫还可能表现出焦躁不安、呼吸急促或无法保持安静的状态。长期的食管阻塞会导致营养吸收不良，动物会出现体重下降、虚弱和疲倦的症状。\n（三）家禽类\n家禽类在食管阻塞时，可能会出现呼吸困难的症状，鸣叫声音变得异常或消失。这些鸟类通常会拒绝食物或表现出进食困难，如反复尝试咀嚼食物却无法吞咽。食管阻塞还可能导致它们无法正常进行羽毛的清洁和维护，使羽毛显得不健康或油腻。\n五、诊断方法\n食管阻塞是动物中常见的急性病症，为了准确诊断并及时治疗，采用多种方法来确认病情。以下是包括体格检查和常见诊断工具在内的诊断方法，以及图像学检查（如X射线、超声波等）的应用。\n（一）体格检查\n体格检查时，兽医通过检查口腔、喉部和气管，观察有无异物或肿块的存在，这包括使用口镜和触诊来评估食管口的情况和周围组织的状况。\n（二）常见的诊断工具\n常见的诊断工具包括X射线检查、超声波检查和内窥镜检查。X射线是最常用的诊断工具之一，可以快速检测出食管内的异物或阻塞部位，动物被保定在X射线机下，医生通过获取的图像来评估食管的通畅性和是否有异常影像的存在。超声波适合检查食管及其周围软组织的情况。对于严重病例或需要进一步确认的情况，兽医通过口腔或鼻腔将柔软的内窥镜引入食管，直接观察食管内部的情况，以发现异物或其他结构性问题。\n六、治疗\n本病的治疗关键在于移除食管内的阻塞物以实现康复。对于咽后食管起始部的阻塞，大型家畜可通过安装开口器，并经由口腔伸手进去移除阻塞物。然而，颈部和胸部食管的阻塞处理则需依据阻塞物的特性和阻塞程度来决定治疗措施。\n（一）疏导法\n当食管阻塞确诊后，对牛、马可给予25～50g水合氯醛配制的2%水溶液进行灌肠，或静脉注射5%水合氯醛酒精注射液200～300ml。随后，灌入50～100ml植物油或液体石蜡。或使用0.5%～1%普鲁卡因溶液10ml配合少量植物油或液体石蜡灌入食管。插入胃管后，缓慢地将阻塞物推向胃内，多数病例可因此治愈。\n（二）挤压法\n当病畜因食用块根饲料导致颈部食管阻塞时，先灌入少量解痉剂和润滑剂。将病畜横卧保定，控制头部和前肢。在颈部食管阻塞部位下方垫上平板或砖块，用手掌抵住阻塞物下端，向咽部方向挤压至口腔，以排出阻塞物。\n（三）通噎法\n主要用于治疗马的食管阻塞。将病马的缰绳系于左前肢系凹部，使马头尽量下垂。驱使病马快速前进、上下坡或进行往返运动约20～30min，利用颈部肌肉收缩帮助阻塞物进入胃内。预先灌入少量植物油或温水可提高效果。也可先灌入100～200ml液体石蜡或植物油，然后皮下注射3%盐酸毛果芸香碱（或硫酸毒扁豆碱）注射液3ml（牛、马剂量），以促进食管肌肉收缩和分泌，有时需3～4 h见效。\n若上述方法均无效，则应考虑手术治疗，通过切开食管取出阻塞物。牛、羊食管阻塞常伴发瘤胃臌胀，应及时进行瘤胃穿刺放气，并采取相应的治疗措施。\n七、预防食管阻塞\n预防食管阻塞需注意动物的饮食和环境，包括将食物切成小块、避免给予危险食物、控制食物摄入量和频率，防止动物接触到可能误食的小物件。\n根据材料总结，食管阻塞有哪些原因和症状，不超过300个汉字。",

      "problem_en": "7 Imaging Examinations\nImaging examinations play an important role in the diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis. The imaging modalities for TB mainly include chest X-ray, chest computed tomography (computed tomography, CT); when necessary, they may be combined with chest contrast-enhanced CT and chest ultrasonography for diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) has limited utility for clarifying the diagnosis of pulmonary TB, but is meaningful for differentiating from other diseases, especially tumors.\n\n7.1 Primary Pulmonary Tuberculosis\nPrimary pulmonary TB is the most common type in children with TB, including primary complex and intrathoracic lymph node TB. The primary complex consists of four components: the pulmonary primary lesion, endobronchial TB, lymphangitis, and pleuritis adjacent to the infectious focus. Imaging only needs to show the primary lesion and hilar lymph node enlargement to establish the diagnosis. Chest CT is more sensitive than X-ray in showing the primary focus and enlargement of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes; enhanced CT showing ring-like enhancement of enlarged lymph nodes has some diagnostic value for lymph node TB; calcification within lymph nodes further clarifies the diagnosis.\n\n7.2 Caseous Pneumonia\nPlain radiographs of caseous pneumonia typically show hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy or surrounding consolidation foci, with or without cavities within the consolidation, calcification, and liquefactive necrosis. Chest CT is more sensitive than X-ray in showing small cavities, faint calcifications, and a few bronchial dissemination foci and enlarged lymph nodes, and can provide a qualitative diagnosis of caseous pneumonia.\n\n7.3 Tracheobronchial TB\nIn children, tracheobronchial TB is often caused by compression of the trachea or bronchi by enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, leading to narrowing or obstruction of the tracheal/bronchial lumen; additionally, caseous material can erode into or into the trachea/bronchi, causing blockage and even dissemination. Imaging features include distortion and thickening of the tracheal and bronchial walls, luminal narrowing or occlusion, adjacent lung consolidation or atelectasis, obstructive emphysema, and peribronchial dissemination. Chest CT is an important means to diagnose tracheobronchial TB and can assess airway status through multiplanar reconstructions and other post-processing techniques; CT can provide a definite diagnosis, whereas chest X-ray findings are non-specific.\n\n7.4 Acute Hematogenous Disseminated Pulmonary TB\nAcute hematogenous disseminated TB on X-ray presents the “three uniform” sign, i.e., millet-like nodules evenly distributed in both lungs with uniform size and density. Subacute or chronic hematogenous disseminated TB features diffuse lesions often distributed in the upper and middle portions of both lungs, varying in size and density and may coalesce. In younger children, the millet nodules are larger, with prominent surrounding reaction and blurred margins; lesions tend to merge, often with enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, caseous pneumonia, and calcifications. High-resolution CT thin-section scanning markedly increases the detectability of early micronodules in miliary TB, especially in atypical cases with ground-glass appearance. For clinically suspected cases with normal chest X-ray, a chest high-resolution CT thin-section scan or periodic follow-up chest X-ray should be performed to avoid missed diagnosis.\n\n7.5 Secondary TB\nSecondary TB in children is less common than primary TB and typically involves the apical-posterior segment of the upper lobe and the posterior basal segment of the lower lobe. Imaging presentations are varied, but in children commonly show parenchymal infiltration, cavitation with bronchial dissemination, and caseous pneumonia. Chest CT findings are similar to those on X-ray, but CT is more sensitive in detecting micro-lesions.\n\n7.6 Tuberculous Pleural Effusion\nTuberculous pleuritis can occur with pulmonary lesions or alone without intrapulmonary lesions. Dry tuberculous pleuritis may have a normal chest X-ray; exudative pleural effusion typically presents as unilateral effusion, often free-flowing. Tuberculous pleuritis is common in children and adolescents. Chest CT diagnosis is superior to X-ray, capable of detecting small amounts of pleural effusion, loculated effusions, and localized pleural thickening caused by direct involvement of the pleura by pulmonary TB lesions. Chest ultrasonography can confirm the presence of effusion, and is more accurate than X-ray for the volume, location, and depth from the chest surface, and can be used to guide thoracentesis.",
      "answer_en": "Imaging examinations are crucial in the diagnosis of pediatric pulmonary tuberculosis, mainly including X-ray, CT, MRI, contrast-enhanced CT, and ultrasound. CT is more sensitive than X-ray in displaying the primary lesion and enlarged lymph nodes, especially in the diagnosis of caseous pneumonia and tracheobronchial tuberculosis. MRI is used to differentiate tuberculosis from tumors in differential diagnosis. High-resolution CT helps in the early detection of hematogenous dissemination of pulmonary tuberculosis. In the diagnosis of tuberculous pleuritis, CT and ultrasound are superior to X-ray.",

      "problem": "你读一下下面的文章，总结患儿家长需要注意的五个核心点。\n\n关于阿奇霉素的使用，这 4 点要记住\n阿奇霉素是临床上常用的广谱抗生素，对厌氧菌、革兰阳性菌、革兰阴性菌、支原体、衣原体等都具有较强的杀菌效果。\n近几年来支原体感染的发生率不断增高，使得药物的利用率也随之增高，我们今天就阿奇霉素的使用进行一下知识总结。\n一、阿奇霉素的给药方式\n口服口服给药是我们最常用的给药方式，口服阿奇霉素，一般是要在餐前 1 小时或餐后 2 小时服用，部分进口的片剂和干混悬剂，可以与食物同时服用。\n因胃肠道反应阿奇霉素最常见的不良反应之一，所以，在儿科用药中多主张餐后服用。\n静脉滴注阿奇霉素的配置：我们可以用 5 ml 的 100 mg/ml 阿奇霉素溶液加入（0.9%NS、5%GS）任何一种溶液中，制备成 1.0～2.0 mg/ml 的阿奇霉素溶液，浓度不得超过 2 mg/mL。\n滴速：建议每 500 mg 本品按照上述方法配置后，它的滴注时间不少于 60 min。\n药物浓度为 1 mg/ml 时，滴注溶液总量为 500 ML，它的滴注时间为 3 h。\n如果浓度 2 mg/ml 时，溶液总量为 250 mL，它的滴注时间应为 1 h。\n阿奇霉素注射液不能静脉推注和肌肉注射。\n二、阿奇霉素要吃三停四\n主要有以下两个方面的原因。\n（1）阿奇霉素在组织中分布广、代谢慢，在人体组织内药物半衰期可达 68 h，临床使用阿奇霉素 3～5d 后，第 12d 时在巨噬细胞及白细胞内仍可以检测到阿奇霉素。\n（2）阿奇霉素的组织渗透性较强，而且在组织与细胞内的阿奇霉素水平能远远超过同期血浓度的 10～100 倍，感染部位的阿奇霉素水平是非感染部位的 6 倍，特别是在肺组织中水平较高且作用时间持久。\n由于以上的特点，口服 3 天的阿奇霉素，即使停用，阿奇霉素浓度依然能在体内持续 3～4d 的时间。\n三、阿奇霉素的药物副作用\n\n1. 胃肠道功能紊乱，临床最为常见，可能与大环内酯抗生素有类促胃肠动力作用有关；\n可使用蒙脱石散防治，在使用阿奇霉素前 10 min，给予蒙脱石散 3 g，用 50 ml 温水冲服，能保护胃肠道黏膜。\n2. 肝功能损害及过敏性皮炎：不常见。\n3. 心律失常：包括 Q-T 间期延长所致的室性心动过速等，较罕见。\n4. 耳毒性：罕见。\n美国食品药品管理局（FDA）对禁忌人群，有如下建议\n（1）确诊的 QT 间期延长，先天性长 QT 间期综合征，尖端扭转型室速病史，心动过缓，或失代偿性心力衰竭不能使用；\n（2）患者处于促心律失常状态，例如未纠正的低钾血症、低镁血症患者不能使用；\n（3）正在使用延长 QT 间期药物的患者，如 ⅠA 型（丙吡胺、奎尼丁、双氢奎尼丁）和 Ⅲ 型（胺碘酮、多非利特、伊布利特、索他洛尔）抗心律失常药物；抗精神病药物；抗抑郁药物；氟喹诺酮类药物（如莫西沙星、左氧氟沙星）；其他药物（西沙比利）治疗的患者不能使用； \n（4）老年心脏病患者对影响 QT 间期的药物更为敏感，所以不能使用。\n四、阿奇霉素的配伍禁忌有哪些？\n\n在药品说明书明确指出：其他静脉内输注物、添加剂、药物不能加入本品中，也不能同时在同一静脉通路中静滴。\n在临床上，因阿奇霉素的胃肠道反应，故常用维生素 B6 等药物添加减轻胃肠道反应，虽然维生素 B6 与阿奇霉素之间没有存在药物禁忌，但为了避免医疗纠纷，不推荐混合添加滴注。\n总结\n1. 临床上医师、护士在应用药物时，要仔细阅读说明书，掌握用法、用量、注意事项、配伍禁忌等。\n2. 加强输液中的观察和巡视，对于特殊用药、新药更要观察仔细，防止意外发生。\n3. 输液过程中，发现药物有变色、浑浊、沉淀等现象，应立即停止输液，更换输液器和液体，根据病情选择葡萄糖注射液或氯化钠注射液。注意和其他药物之间的时间间隔，不将有配伍禁忌的药物联合使用。\n\n\n治疗儿童支原体肺炎：阿奇霉素为什么要停 4 天？\n肺炎支原体是儿童社区获得性肺炎的重要病原体之一。小儿支原体肺炎又称为原发性非典型肺炎，占到住院儿童社区获得性肺炎的 10%～40%。大环内酯类药物成为肺炎支原体治疗的首选。\n其中，阿奇霉素在药效学、药动学、不良反应方面有着其他药物无法比拟的优势，成为治疗儿童支原体肺炎的首选药物。\n阿奇霉素在治疗儿童支原体肺炎时，临床有的用 3 天，停 4 天，有的用 5 天，停 4 天，再重复第 2 疗程。临床为什么要停 4 天，而不是连续应用呢？\n我们根据阿奇霉素的药动学、药效学、不良反应及细菌耐药特点来分析一下为什么要停 4 天。\n阿奇霉素是具有 15 元氮杂内酯环的半合成大环内酯类抗生素。化学结构系在红霉素 A 内酯环的 9a 位上内插一个含有取代甲基的氮原子，经修饰后成为新一代的大环内酯类抗菌药物。由于化学结构的改变, 使药物有较好的抗菌特性、药动学特性和治疗效果。\n1. 药动学特点 - 半衰期长\n· \n阿奇霉素在组织中分布广，代谢慢，组织内药物半衰期可达 68 小时。\n· \n· \n研究发现，使用阿奇霉素 3～5d 后，第 12d 时在巨噬细胞及白细胞内仍可以检测到阿奇霉素。巨噬细胞可以把阿奇霉素转运到机体的炎症部位，所以阿奇霉素的组织渗透性较强，而且在组织与细胞内的阿奇霉素水平能远远超过同期血浓度的 10～100 倍，感染部位的阿奇霉素水平是非感染部位的 6 倍，特别是在肺组织中水平较高且作用时间持久。\n· \n· \n因此，服药 3 天后，即使停用，阿奇霉素依然能在体内持续作用 3～4 天。\n· \n2. 药效学特点 - 抗菌药物后效应\n· \n与其他抗菌药物如青霉素类、头孢菌素类不同的是，阿奇霉素药具有明显的「抗菌药物后效应」。\n· \n· \n所谓抗菌药物后效应，就是指停用抗菌药物后，药物的血药浓度即使低于最低抑菌浓度（MIC），而细菌仍在一定时间内处于被抑制状态，不能生长。\n· \n· \n虽然从表面上看应用阿奇霉素 3 天后停掉了，但实际上在停药后，病原体仍旧处于被抑制状态。\n· \n3. 不良反应特点 - 减少用药时间，降低胃肠道反应\n· \n由于肺炎支原体肺炎具有较长病程，通常可持续 3 周时间，甚至更长。并且阿奇霉素的胃肠道反应和用药时间成正相关。\n· \n· \n加上患儿治疗依从性比较差，长期连续静脉滴注治疗，患儿容易出现严重的胃肠道不良反应，还伴有穿刺处疼痛、皮疹、静脉炎等症状。\n· \n· \n因此，用 3 天，停 4 天可减少阿奇霉素的不良反应。\n· \n4. 细菌耐药特点 - 连续用药，易产生耐药\n魏玮等曾经对阿奇霉素连续和间歇给药治疗支原体肺炎的疗效及耐药性进行了研究：\n· \n结果发现用药 3d 后 MIC 值有升高的趋势， 但并无统计学意义；\n· \n· \n用药 12d 后，连续给药组 MIC 值却有明显升高，而此时血药浓度已低于 MIC 值，进而增加了产生耐药支原体肺炎的风险。\n· \n综上所述，阿奇霉素间歇疗法无论是从用药的安全性、经济性、依从性、便宜性、耐药性都要优于连续给药，并且疗效相当。\n因此，《儿童肺炎支原体肺炎诊治专家共识 (2015 年版)》里面阿奇霉素用法为：10 mg/(kg·d)，每天 1 次，轻症 3 天为 1 个疗程， 重症可连用 5～7 天，4 天后可重复第 2 个疗程（但对于婴儿，阿奇霉素的使用尤其是静脉制剂的使用要慎重）。\n本文作者：首都医科大学附属北京潞河医院 刘宪军\n参考文献\n[1] 马丁代尔药典（第 37 版）.\n[2] 中国医师药师临床用药指南 (第 2 版) .\n[3] MICROMEDEX 事实数据库.\n[4] ABX 指南—感染性疾病的诊断与治疗. 第二版.John G.

      "problem_en": "Please read the following article and summarize the five core points that parents of pediatric patients should pay attention to.\n\n1) Routes of administration and use of azithromycin\nAzithromycin is a commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotic in clinical practice, with strong bactericidal effects against anaerobic bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma, and Chlamydia.\nIn recent years, the incidence of mycoplasma infections has been rising, leading to increased drug utilization. Here is a knowledge summary on the use of azithromycin.\n1.1 Oral administration\nOral administration is the most common route. When taken orally, azithromycin is generally administered 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals; some imported tablets and dry suspensions can be taken with food.\nBecause gastrointestinal reactions are among the most common adverse effects of azithromycin, pediatric use often recommends taking after meals.\n1.2 Intravenous infusion preparation\nWe can add 5 mL of a 100 mg/mL azithromycin solution to either 0.9% NS or 5% glucose solution to prepare an azithromycin solution of 1.0–2.0 mg/mL, with concentrations not exceeding 2 mg/mL.\nDrip rate: After preparing 500 mg of the product by the above method, the infusion time should be no less than 60 minutes.\nIf the concentration is 1 mg/mL, the total infusion volume is 500 mL, and the infusion time is 3 hours.\nIf the concentration is 2 mg/mL, the total volume is 250 mL, and the infusion time should be 1 hour.\nAzithromycin injection cannot be given by IV push or intramuscular injection.\n\n2) Azithromycin should be taken in a 3 days on, 4 days off pattern\nThere are two main reasons:\n(1) Azithromycin distributes widely in tissues and is metabolized slowly; the drug half-life in human tissues can reach 68 hours. After 3–5 days of clinical use, azithromycin can still be detected in macrophages and leukocytes on day 12.\n(2) Azithromycin has strong tissue penetration, and its levels in tissues and cells can be 10–100 times higher than concurrent blood concentrations; at infection sites, azithromycin levels can be about 6 times those at non-infected sites, especially in lung tissue where levels are higher and duration is longer.\nTherefore, after 3 days of oral therapy, even if stopped, azithromycin concentrations can remain in the body for 3–4 days.\n\n3) Adverse reactions of azithromycin\n1. Gastrointestinal disturbance, the most common adverse effect clinically, possibly related to the prokinetic effect of macrolide antibiotics.\nSmectite (montmorillonite) can be used to prevent/treat it; 3 g of smectite, taken with 50 mL of warm water, 10 minutes before using azithromycin, can protect the gastrointestinal mucosa.\n2. Liver function damage and allergic dermatitis: uncommon.\n3. Arrhythmias: including torsades de pointes due to QT interval prolongation; relatively rare.\n4. Ototoxicity: rare.\nFDA contraindications\n(1) Diagnosed QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, history of torsades de pointes, bradycardia, or decompensated heart failure cannot use;\n(2) Patients in proarrhythmic states, such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, cannot use;\n(3) Patients currently using QT-prolonging drugs, such as Class I A (procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide) and Class III (amiodarone, dofetilide, ibutilide, sotalol) antiarrhythmic drugs; antipsychotics; antidepressants; fluoroquinolones (e.g., moxifloxacin, levofloxacin); other drugs (Xisabili) therapy cannot use;\n(4) Elderly patients with heart disease are more sensitive to QT-prolonging drugs, so they should not use.\n\n4) What are the drug compatibility/Drug interaction restrictions for azithromycin?\nThe drug label clearly states that other intravenous infusions, additives, and drugs cannot be added to this product, nor can they be infused through the same IV line.\nIn clinical practice, due to azithromycin’s gastrointestinal reactions, additives such as vitamin B6 are sometimes used to reduce GI symptoms. Although there is no pharmacological contraindication between vitamin B6 and azithromycin, to avoid medical disputes, mixing in the infusion is not recommended.\n\nSummary\n1) Clinicians and nurses should carefully read the instructions, master the usage, dosing, precautions, and incompatibilities.\n2) Strengthen monitoring during infusions and rounds; for special or new drugs, observe closely to prevent adverse events.\n3) During infusion, if the drug shows color changes, turbidity, or precipitation, stop the infusion immediately, replace the infusion set and solution, and, depending on the condition, choose glucose or saline injections. Mind the time intervals with other drugs and do not use drugs with incompatibilities together.\n\nTreating Mycoplasma pneumonia in children: why stop azithromycin for 4 days?\nMycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the important pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia in children. Pediatric mycoplasma pneumonia, also known as primary atypical pneumonia, accounts for 10%–40% of hospitalized children with community-acquired pneumonia. Macrolide antibiotics have become the first choice for treating Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\nAmong them, azithromycin has advantages in pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects that other drugs cannot match, making it the first-line drug for treating pediatric Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nIn treating pediatric Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia, some clinicians use 3 days on, 4 days off; some use 5 days on, 4 days off, then repeat a second course. Why stop for 4 days instead of continuing?\nWe analyze why to stop for 4 days based on azithromycin’s pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, adverse effects, and bacterial resistance characteristics.\nAzithromycin is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic with a 15-membered nitrogen-containing lactone ring. Its chemical structure is based on erythromycin A, in which a nitrogen atom bearing a substituted methyl group is inserted at the 9a position of the lactone ring, creating a new generation macrolide. This structural modification gives the drug better antibacterial properties, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy.\n1. Pharmacokinetic characteristics — long half-life\nAzithromycin distributes widely in tissues and is metabolized slowly; tissue half-life can reach up to 68 hours.\nStudies show that after 3–5 days of azithromycin use, azithromycin can still be detected in macrophages and leukocytes on day 12. Macrophages can transport azithromycin to sites of inflammation, so tissue penetration is strong; concentrations in tissues and cells can be 10–100 times higher than concurrent plasma levels; infection-site levels are about 6 times those in non-infected sites, especially in the lungs where levels are higher and duration is longer.\nTherefore, after 3 days of dosing, even if stopped, azithromycin can continue to exert effects in the body for 3–4 days.\n2. Pharmacodynamic characteristics — post-antibiotic effect\nUnlike other antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins, azithromycin exhibits a pronounced post-antibiotic effect (PAE).\nPAE means that after stopping the antibiotic, even if blood concentrations fall below MIC, bacteria remain suppressed for a period and cannot grow.\nAlthough it may appear that treatment is stopped after 3 days, in fact, the pathogen remains suppressed after stopping.\n3. Adverse reaction characteristics — reducing therapy duration to lessen GI reactions\nMycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia typically has a long course, often lasting about 3 weeks or longer. In addition, azithromycin’s GI adverse reactions are related to the duration of therapy.\nCombined with relatively poor treatment adherence in children and the drawback of long-term IV infusions (pain at the puncture site, rashes, phlebitis, etc.), using 3 days on and 4 days off can reduce azithromycin’s adverse reactions.\n4. Bacterial resistance characteristics — continuous use fosters resistance\nWei Wei and colleagues studied continuous versus intermittent azithromycin therapy for Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia:\n- After 3 days, MIC tended to rise but was not statistically significant.\n- After 12 days, the continuous-dosing group showed a clear MIC increase, at which time blood levels were below MIC, increasing the risk of resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\nIn summary, intermittent azithromycin therapy is safer, more economical, and better for adherence and resistance, while achieving similar efficacy compared with continuous dosing.\nThus, the Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pediatric Mycoplasma Pneumonia (2015 edition) recommends: 10 mg/(kg·d), once daily; mild cases for 3 days constitute one course; severe cases may continue for 5–7 days; after 4 days, a second course may be repeated (but for infants, azithromycin use, especially the IV preparation, should be used with caution).\nAuthor: Liu Xianjun, Beijing Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University\n\nReferences\n[1] Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference (37th edition).\n[2] Clinical Pharmacology Guidelines for Physicians and Pharmacists in China (2nd edition).\n[3] MICROMEDEX Facts Database.\n[4] ABX Guidelines—Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, 2nd edition.

Journal of Southern Medical University, 2010, 30(08): 1918-1919.\n\nAzithromycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can be used in children to treat bacterial infections, such as otitis media, pneumonia, and pharyngitis.\n1) Azithromycin dosage: The exact dosage should be determined based on the child’s weight and the specific condition, under a physician’s guidance. Generally, the dose is about 10 mg–12 mg per kilogram of body weight. If using a suspension, for children aged 3–7 years with a weight of 15 kg–25 kg, 5 mL may be used; for heavier children aged 8–11 years, 7.5 mL may be needed; for ages 12–14 years with a weight of 36 kg–45 kg, 10 mL may be required.\n2) Azithromycin administration: Azithromycin is usually given orally and can be mixed with water before administration. For children who cannot take it orally or require rapid onset, intravenous administration can be chosen. The specific treatment course depends on the severity of the infection; during treatment, regardless of whether symptoms disappear, the child should complete the full course as instructed by the doctor to ensure the pathogen is completely eradicated and to prevent relapse or the development of resistance.\nDuring treatment, monitor the child’s response; if an allergic reaction occurs, seek medical attention promptly. Also, during treatment, a light diet is advised, and avoid spicy or irritating foods and drinks.",
      "answer_en": "According to the article, parents of the child should pay attention to the following five core points when using azithromycin:\n\n1. **Administration method and timing**: Azithromycin is typically administered orally; it is recommended to take after meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. When administering intravenous infusion, pay attention to drug preparation and infusion rate, avoiding IV push and intramuscular injections.\n\n2. **Dosing cycle**: Azithromycin has a long-acting effect and is usually given in an intermittent therapy of \"three days on, four days off.\" That is, take for three days and stop for four days, which can reduce adverse reactions and lower the risk of resistance.\n\n3. **Drug side effects**: Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal disturbances; less common are liver function impairment, arrhythmias, and ototoxicity. If an allergic reaction or other discomfort occurs, seek medical care promptly.\n\n4. **Contraindications and incompatibilities**: Use is contraindicated in patients with QT interval prolongation, bradycardia, and other cardiac issues. Azithromycin should not be mixed with certain drugs and should be avoided with other intravenous infusions.\n\n5. **Follow the doctor's instructions**: Parents should adjust the dosage according to the child’s weight and condition under the physician's guidance, and ensure completion of the full course to prevent resistance and disease recurrence. Monitor the child’s response during treatment and maintain a bland diet. If an allergic reaction occurs, seek medical attention promptly.",

      "problem": "妊娠期的骨头情变\n骨骼负荷身体的重量，让我们能自由行动，它还是体内钙和磷的贮存库，在整个孕期扮演着重要的角色。孕妇大腹便便，难免会有腰酸，四肢及躯干疼痛的困扰，但有些状况却不能忽视，可能是骨骼肌肉系统病变发出的警报信号。\n妊娠股骨头坏死\n怀孕4个月时，我的腹部沉重起来，左侧睡时间长了，会感到不适。从怀孕6个月开始我出现了腰痛，程度与孕期俱增。特别是晚上睡觉的时候，背都直不起。走路、打喷嚏、用力解大小便时，疼痛更加厉害。即使坐着也要垫上厚厚的垫子，背靠在沙发上，用双手从下方托起重重的垂腹，腰部才轻松些。过了两个月，臀部、大腿和膝盖内侧也开始酸痛。亲友长辈都说孕妇腰酸背痛是正常的，于是我也没多在意。\n坐月子期间，怀孕时的不适感，非但没有减轻，反而逐渐加剧。痛到右脚无力举起，类似长短脚般拖着走路，在家里上个厕所竟要走十来分钟，可用举步维艰来形容。被逼无奈，我来到医院。\n医生说：“怀孕期间腹中胎儿的重量不断增加，腰背肌、脊背两侧的肌肉就要承担更多的重量，加上荷尔蒙改变的关系，所以会明显感觉到腰酸背痛。约一半的孕妇会存在这种生理性反应。以往认为这是怀孕时的不可避免之痛，生产后自然会随着时间改善，然而少数情况却非如此，如果腿脚也酸痛、无法正常行走就要特别注意。”\n我的诊断结果为妊娠股骨头缺血性坏死，吓坏了全家人。\n“这是指骨组织因血液供应不足，进而产生骨细胞死亡之现象。孕妇发病原因不明。相关研究文献指出，可能与雌激素与黄体素的浓度改变，怀孕后期母体血中类固醇浓度上升有关。根据过去的医学报告，初次怀孕年龄较大，怀孕期间体重增加过多，口服或注射排卵药皆有可能相关。”医生解释。\n“骨头坏死了，是不是就像骨头断了一样，今后就残废了？”我焦急地问。\n“的确有致残的可能，但这个病也有轻重之分，不同的情况处理不同。针对你可采用股骨头中心减压手术，以消除疼痛，使坏死组织再生，不会致残。手术后疼痛得难以入睡的情况可消失，走路也顺利正常。但一些严重患者则需通过置换人工关节来替代完全坏死的骨骼。”\n“鼠标手”妈妈\n我是一名会计，工作时每天有6个小时和电脑打交道。\n怀孕7个月的一天早上，刚睡醒的我觉得右手手指有点僵硬，以为是睡觉压到了，也没怎么注意。后来手断断续续地刺痛、酸麻，肿得握不紧，一摁一个白印几分钟才能恢复。老公说是我晚上老把手伸到被子外面冻的。有同事看见我肿胀的双手，问我是不是做家务时太用劲。我说：“没有呀！平时家务由妈妈代劳，在公司也没有提过重物。”\n因为连续使用鼠标，一天N次的点击使我的手渐渐不听使唤，连反手穿内衣都是种折磨。不仅做不了穿针引线之类的精细活，做事情也使不上劲，摔盘子砸碗是常有的事。我生怕生下宝宝后却抱不住他。\n医生说没有外伤史，是“腕管综合征”，俗名“鼠标手”。我纳闷：“腕管综合征到底是什么？”\n医生指着手部解剖图比划，“每个人的手腕中有一条狭窄的骨质通道，称为腕管。它就像一座拱桥，有9根从前臂来的屈指肌腱和一根正中神经从中间穿过，通向五个手指。任何原因引起的腕管内压力增高，如外源性压迫、管腔本身变小及腔内容物增多等，均会使屈指肌腱和正中神经受到压迫，随即疼痛、麻木和刺痛等猛烈的神经冲动像火花一样从手部传开。\n“在键盘上打字和移动鼠标，手腕背屈向下弯，使得腕部和给手指供血的血管处于受压状态。长期让手无休无止地工作，慢慢地债越欠越多，它的讨债方式就是——生病，罢工。\n“这种病通常发生在和电脑亲密过度的工作族身上，比如计算机编程人员、会计、编辑、记者。但是它也会出现在不用电脑的人身上，尤其在孕妇中更为普遍。”\n“啊，为什么？”\n“这和准妈妈的生理变化直接相关。由于妊娠后体内激素增加，尤其是雌激素，易造成钠水滞留，引起手腕处水肿，而腕管内的容积是一定的，使得这条“通道”更为拥挤不堪，令被限制在腕管中的正中神经受压。\n“患者大多较年轻，平均年龄为30岁左右。一般两只手都会出现这些症状，而且在孕期的任何时候都可能发生，但在怀孕的后半阶段更有可能发生或加重，因为这时孕妇体内开始滞留越来越多的液体。\n“不及时医治，会很麻烦，因为正中神经如果被卡压太久比较难恢复正常，医好了也有麻痹等不舒适的症状。”\n“我是不是拖得太久了？”我眉头紧锁。\n“不必过分担忧紧张，腕管综合征一般不严重，可以等生完孩子再看会不会自己好。如果宝宝出生几个月后还备受困扰，那一定要在产后检查时告诉医生。”\n“我现在痛得厉害，有什么方法可以缓解吗？”\n“饮食清淡少盐，吃富含维生素B的食物有助于营养神经。准妈妈要减少使用电脑的时间，如果不行，换个自己感觉舒服的鼠标，买一个腕托安在键盘上。每使用一个小时电脑，进行一下手部按摩，如用一只手紧握另一只手的手腕，打圈转动。用热毛巾敷或将双手放在温热水中浸泡十余分钟以减轻局部刺激和疼痛。睡觉时最好把手放在枕头上，这样血液回流好些。”\n\n骨盆变形，竟是软骨病作怪\n我生活在边远贫困山区，曾流产过两次，原因不明。得知再次怀孕的那一刻，我和丈夫既兴奋又紧张。好不容易度过了最危险的三个月，我却经常头晕倦怠、四肢无力，容易腰酸背疼，有时甚至还小腿抽筋。更为奇怪的是，怀孕后我居然变矮了。由于离医院路途遥远，怀孕5个月时我才到医院做第一次产检，发现骨盆倾斜变形了。\n医生说：“你患了软骨病，是严重缺乏维生素D与钙的结果。早期表现为腰酸腿痛，活动时加重，久之骨质疏松，长期得不到治疗会导致脊柱弯曲、身材变矮，甚至骨盆变形而出现分娩困难。女性在妊娠期要量量身高，如果身高下降了3厘米，就要引起注意了，及时到医院检查治疗。”\n“为什么会发生这种病？”站在一旁的丈夫摸着我的手问。\n“多次妊娠、多次分娩和体质虚弱的女性易患此病。少数病例是肾小管病变或酶缺陷、肝病、抗惊厥药等所致。\n“因为孕期钙的需要量增加，大约要贮存50克钙，其中25~30克为胎儿生长发育所需。饮食中钙摄入量不足时，胎儿仍从母体摄取生长发育所需的钙，易引起孕妇缺钙，诱发小腿抽筋、下肢麻木、牙齿松动、腰酸背痛等，还会增加软骨病、妊娠高血压的发病率。孕妇缺钙不仅对自身健康不利，而且对腹中胎儿也有危害，影响胎儿骨骼的发育，导致胎儿宫内发育迟缓，严重者出现先天性骨软化症。”\n听到这么严重的后果，我急得冒汗，“怎么办呀？”\n“补钙是准妈妈们保护自身与胎儿健康的护身符，多食奶制品、豆制品、海带、虾皮、鱼类等。多晒太阳，常进行散步等较舒缓的运动，能促进人体维生素D合成，帮助钙的吸收和利用。改善饮食、补充维生素D及钙即可治愈，但已形成的骨骼畸形不能恢复。根据你的骨盆测量数据，建议生产时选择剖腹产。”#孕期保健#\n孕期的骨头情变有哪些，为什么这样？分条叙述，每条不超过50字。",

      "problem_en": "Bone Changes During Pregnancy\n\nThe skeleton bears the weight of the body, enabling us to move freely, and it also serves as a reservoir for calcium and phosphorus in the body, playing an important role throughout pregnancy.\n\nPregnancy-associated femoral head avascular necrosis\nAt four months of pregnancy, my abdomen became heavy, and lying on my left side for long periods caused discomfort. From six months, I developed back pain that worsened as the pregnancy progressed. Especially at night, I could not even straighten my back when lying down. Pain worsened with walking, sneezing, or bearing down to pass stool or urine. Even while sitting, I had to prop myself with thick cushions, lean my back against the sofa, and lift the heavy abdomen from underneath with both hands to ease the lower back. After two months, pain spread to the buttocks, thighs, and inner aspects of the knees. Relatives and elders told me that backache during pregnancy is normal, so I did not pay much attention.\n\nDuring the postpartum confinement period, the discomfort during pregnancy not only did not ease but gradually worsened. The pain became so severe that the right leg felt weak and could not lift, dragging as if I had a leg length discrepancy. Walking to the bathroom at home took about ten minutes; it was a struggle. Desperate, I went to the hospital.\nThe doctor said: “During pregnancy, the increasing weight of the fetus means the back muscles and the muscles on both sides of the spine must bear more weight. Coupled with hormonal changes, you’ll clearly feel low back and waist pain. About half of pregnant women experience this physiological response. It was previously thought to be an unavoidable pain of pregnancy that would improve after delivery with time; however in some cases this is not so. If the legs or feet also ache, and you cannot walk normally, you should pay special attention.”\n\nMy diagnosis was pregnancy-associated femoral head avascular necrosis (ischemic necrosis), which scared my whole family.\n“This refers to bone tissue death due to insufficient blood supply. The cause of illness in pregnant women is unknown. Related literature suggests it may be related to changes in estrogen and progesterone concentrations, and rising maternal steroid levels in late pregnancy. According to past medical reports, older age at first pregnancy, excessive weight gain during pregnancy, and use of ovulation drugs orally or by injection may be related,” the doctor explained.\n“My bone has died—does that mean it’s like a broken bone and I’ll be disabled in the future?” I asked anxiously.\n“Indeed there is a risk of disability, but the disease varies in severity; different cases are treated differently. For you, a femoral head core decompression procedure can relieve pain, promote regeneration of necrotic tissue, and prevent disability. After surgery, pain that kept you from sleeping can disappear, and walking can return to normal. But some severe patients may require artificial hip joint replacement to replace the completely necrotic bone.”\n\nThe “Mouse-Hand” Mom\nI am an accountant; I work with a computer for six hours each day.\nOne morning at seven months pregnant, after waking, I felt my right-hand fingers were a bit stiff, which I thought was from sleeping on it. Later the hand became intermittently stinging, numb, and swollen to the point that I couldn’t grip tightly; pressing it left a white imprint for a few minutes to recover. My husband said I often stuck my hand outside the covers at night to keep it cold. A colleague saw my swollen hands and asked if I was overexerting myself with chores. I said, “No! Normally my mother handles the housework, and at work I don’t lift heavy items.”\n\nBecause I used the mouse continuously, dozens of clicks per day gradually made my hand unresponsive, and even turning my other hand to button a bra became a torture. I couldn’t do delicate tasks like threading a needle; I lacked strength to do things, and dropping dishes and smashing bowls happened often. I feared I wouldn’t be able to hold my baby after birth.\n\nThe doctor said there was no history of trauma; it is “carpal tunnel syndrome,” commonly known as “mouse hand.” I asked, “What exactly is carpal tunnel syndrome?”\n\nThe doctor pointed to an anatomy diagram of the hand and explained, “Every wrist contains a narrow bony passage called the carpal tunnel. It is like an arch bridge through which nine flexor tendons and one median nerve pass from the forearm to the fingers. Any cause that raises the pressure inside the carpal tunnel—external compression, narrowing of the tunnel itself, or increased contents—will compress the flexor tendons and the median nerve, causing pain, numbness, and tingling that shoot from the hand like sparks.\n“With typing on a keyboard and moving the mouse, the wrist flexes downward, placing pressure on the vessels that supply blood to the wrist and fingers. Prolonged, repetitive hand use accumulates debt, and its debt-collection method is illness and malfunction.\n“Usually this condition occurs in workers who are closely tied to computers, such as programmers, accountants, editors, and journalists. But it can also occur in people who do not use computers, and it is more common among pregnant women.”\n\n“Ah, why?”\n\n“This is directly related to physiological changes in the expectant mother. Because hormone levels rise during pregnancy, especially estrogen, there is a tendency for sodium and water retention, causing swelling of the wrists. The carpal tunnel’s volume is fixed, so the channel becomes more crowded, compressing the median nerve inside.\n“Most patients are relatively young, with an average age around 30. Usually both hands develop these symptoms, and they can occur at any time during pregnancy, but are more likely to occur or worsen in the latter half when more fluid is retained.\n“If not treated promptly, it can be troublesome, because if the median nerve is compressed for too long it is harder to restore normal function; even after treatment there can be numbness or other uncomfortable symptoms.”\n\n“Have I waited too long?”\n\n“Don’t worry excessively; carpal tunnel syndrome is generally not severe. You can wait until after childbirth to see if it improves. If the baby is born and still troubled a few months later, be sure to tell your doctor at postpartum checkups.”\n\n“I’m in a lot of pain now; is there any way to relieve it?”\n\n“Eat a light, low-salt diet; consume foods rich in vitamins B to nourish the nerves. Expectant mothers should reduce computer use; if that’s not possible, switch to a more comfortable mouse and place a wrist rest on the keyboard. After every hour of computer use, massage your hands, for example by clasping one hand around the other wrist and making circular motions. Use a warm towel or soak both hands in warm water for more than ten minutes to ease local irritation and pain. When sleeping, it’s best to place your hands on a pillow to improve blood return.”\n\nPelvic Deformation, Caused by Rickets\nI live in a remote, poor mountainous area and have had two miscarriages for unknown reasons. When I learned I was pregnant again, my husband and I were excited and nervous. After surviving the most dangerous three months, I often felt dizzy and fatigued, with weakness in the limbs, back and waist pain, and sometimes calf cramps. Even more strangely, I became shorter after becoming pregnant. Because the distance to the hospital is long, I did not have my first prenatal checkup until five months into the pregnancy and found that the pelvis was tilted and deformed.\nThe doctor said: “You have osteomalacia (rickets), the result of severe deficiency of vitamin D and calcium. Early symptoms are low back and leg pain that worsens with activity; over time, osteoporosis can develop, and without long-term treatment can cause spinal curvature, shortened stature, and even pelvic deformity leading to delivery difficulties. Women should measure their height during pregnancy; if height decreases by 3 centimeters, you should seek medical attention promptly.”\n“Why does this happen?” asked my husband, touching my hand.\n“Repeated pregnancies and deliveries, and frail physical condition predispose to this disease. In rare cases, renal tubular disorders or enzyme deficiencies, liver disease, and anticonvulsant medications may contribute.\n“Because calcium needs increase during pregnancy, about 50 grams of calcium must be stored, of which 25–30 grams are required for fetal growth and development. If dietary calcium intake is insufficient, the fetus will still take calcium from the mother for growth and development, leading to maternal calcium deficiency, causing calf cramps, numbness in the lower limbs, loose teeth, back pain, and increasing the risk of osteomalacia and gestational hypertension. Calcium deficiency in pregnant women is harmful not only to their own health but also to the fetus, affecting fetal skeletal development and causing intrauterine growth restriction; in severe cases congenital osteomalacia.”\nHearing such severe consequences, I broke into a sweat. “What can I do?”\n“Calcium supplementation is the protective talisman for both mother and fetus. Eat more dairy products, soy products, kelp, dried shrimp, and fish. Get more sun exposure and engage in gentle activities like walking to boost vitamin D synthesis, which helps calcium absorption and utilization. Improving diet and supplementing with vitamin D and calcium can cure, but established skeletal deformities cannot be reversed. Based on your pelvic measurements, cesarean delivery is recommended.”\n#PrenatalCare#\nWhat bone changes occur during pregnancy, and why?

      "sanswer": "阿奇霉素的使用\n阿奇霉素作为一种广谱抗生素，其抗菌范围涵盖厌氧菌、革兰阳性菌、革兰阴性菌、支原体及衣原体等，因治疗支原体感染而被广泛应用。其给药途径主要有两种。口服时，通常建议在餐前1小时或餐后2小时服用；而静脉滴注则需将阿奇霉素溶液稀释至1.0～2.0 mg/ml，并确保滴注时间不少于60分钟。此外，阿奇霉素注射液禁止静脉推注和肌肉注射。\n阿奇霉素的用药原则为“吃三停四”，这一原则基于其在组织中广泛的分布、缓慢的代谢以及持久的作用时间。阿奇霉素在组织和细胞内的浓度可远超血液浓度，在感染部位浓度可达到非感染部位的6倍。然而，阿奇霉素的使用也可能引发一系列副作用，包括胃肠道功能紊乱、肝功能损害、过敏性皮炎、心律失常及耳毒性等，其中胃肠道反应最为常见。因此，临床应用时需密切监测患者的反应，并采取相应的预防措施。\n在使用阿奇霉素时，还需注意其配伍禁忌，避免与其他药物在同一静脉通路中同时输注，以防止可能不良反应。此外，对于确诊QT间期延长、未纠正的电解质紊乱患者以及老年心脏病患者，应禁用阿奇霉素。总之，临床医师和护士在使用阿奇霉素时应严格遵循说明书，掌握正确的用法用量，加强用药观察，以保障患者的安全和治疗效果。",

      "problem_en": "Four points to remember about the use of azithromycin\nAzithromycin is a commonly used broad‑spectrum antibiotic in clinical practice, with potent bactericidal activity against anaerobic bacteria, Gram‑positive bacteria, Gram‑negative bacteria, mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and others. In recent years the incidence of mycoplasma infections has been rising, leading to increased use of the drug; here we summarize the use of azithromycin.\n1. Routes of administration of azithromycin\nOral administration is the most common route. For oral azithromycin, it is generally taken 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals; some imported tablets and dry suspensions can be taken with meals. Because gastrointestinal reactions are among the most common adverse effects of azithromycin, pediatric use often recommends taking it after meals.\nIntravenous preparation: We can reconstitute by adding 5 mL of 100 mg/mL azithromycin solution to either 0.9% NaCl (0.9% NS) or 5% dextrose solution (5% GS) to obtain a final azithromycin solution of 1.0–2.0 mg/mL, concentrations must not exceed 2 mg/mL.\nInfusion rate: After preparing 500 mg of the product by the above method, the infusion time should be no less than 60 minutes.\nWhen the concentration is 1 mg/mL, the total infusion volume is 500 mL, and the infusion time is 3 hours.\nIf the concentration is 2 mg/mL, the total volume is 250 mL, and the infusion time should be 1 hour.\nAzithromycin injections should not be given by intravenous push or intramuscular injection.\n2. The “three-day course” of azithromycin\nThere are two main reasons:\n(1) Azithromycin distributes widely in tissues and is metabolized slowly; the drug half-life in human tissues can reach up to 68 h. After 3–5 days of clinical use, azithromycin can still be detected in macrophages and leukocytes on day 12.\n(2) Azithromycin has strong tissue penetration; tissue and intracellular levels can be 10–100 times higher than concurrent plasma concentrations, and infection-site levels can be about six times those at non-infected sites, with particularly high and prolonged exposure in lung tissue.\nDue to these characteristics, a three‑day course of oral azithromycin can maintain concentrations in the body for 3–4 days after cessation.\n3. Adverse effects of azithromycin\n1. Gastrointestinal disturbances, the most common adverse effect, possibly related to the prokinetic effects of macrolide antibiotics; smectite (montmorillonite) powder can be used to prevent/treat. Administer 3 g of smectite powder with 50 mL warm water 10 minutes before taking azithromycin to protect the GI mucosa.\n2. Liver function impairment and allergic dermatitis: uncommon.\n3. Arrhythmias: including torsades de pointes caused by QT interval prolongation; rare.\n4. Ototoxicity: rare.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the following recommendations for contraindicated populations:\n(1) Do not use in patients with confirmed QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a history of torsades de pointes, bradycardia, or decompensated heart failure.\n(2) Do not use in patients in proarrhythmic states, such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.\n(3) Do not use in patients currently taking QT‑prolonging drugs, such as Class Ia (procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide) and Class III (amiodarone, dofetilide, ibutilide, sotalol) antiarrhythmics; antipsychotics; antidepressants; fluoroquinolones (e.g., moxifloxacin, levofloxacin); and other drugs (thioridazine).\n(4) Elderly patients with heart disease are more sensitive to QT‑prolonging drugs, so should not use.\n4. What are the incompatibilities of azithromycin?\nThe labeling clearly states that other intravenous infusions, additives, and drugs must not be mixed with this product, nor can they be administered through the same IV line.\nClinically, due to azithromycin’s gastrointestinal side effects, vitamins such as B6 are sometimes added to alleviate GI symptoms; although there is no documented contraindication between vitamin B6 and azithromycin, to avoid medicolegal issues, mixing additives into the infusion is not recommended.\nSummary\n1. Clinicians and nurses should carefully read the product insert when administering medications, and master the indications, dosing, precautions, and incompatibilities.\n2. Strengthen monitoring during infusions; for special or new drugs, observe carefully to prevent adverse events.\n3. If during infusion the drug discolorates, becomes turbid, or forms precipitates, stop the infusion immediately, replace the infusion set and solution, and, depending on the clinical situation, choose dextrose injection or normal saline injection. Be mindful of time intervals with other drugs and do not co‑administer drugs with incompatibilities.",
      "answer_en": "Use of Azithromycin\nAzithromycin, as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, has an antibacterial spectrum that covers anaerobes, Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma and chlamydia, and is widely used for the treatment of mycoplasma infections. There are two main routes of administration. Orally, it is usually recommended to take it 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals; for intravenous infusion, the azithromycin solution should be diluted to 1.0–2.0 mg/mL, and the infusion time should be no less than 60 minutes. In addition, azithromycin injection is contraindicated for intravenous push and intramuscular injection.\nThe dosing principle for azithromycin is the “three on, four off” rule, based on its broad distribution in tissues, slow metabolism, and long duration of action. Azithromycin concentrations in tissues and cells can far exceed blood concentrations, and at infection sites concentrations can reach six times those at non-infected sites. However, azithromycin use may also trigger a range of adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, liver function impairment, hypersensitive dermatitis, arrhythmias, and ototoxicity, among which gastrointestinal reactions are the most common. Therefore, in clinical practice, patients’ responses should be closely monitored, and corresponding preventive measures should be taken.\nWhen using azithromycin, attention should also be paid to compatibilities and contraindications, avoiding simultaneous infusion with other drugs in the same IV line to prevent possible adverse reactions. In addition, azithromycin is contraindicated for patients with diagnosed QT interval prolongation, uncorrected electrolyte disturbances, and elderly patients with heart disease. In summary, clinicians and nurses should strictly follow the instructions for use of azithromycin, master the correct usage and dosage, and strengthen pharmacovigilance to ensure patient safety and treatment efficacy.",

Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan 5.3.\n\nResults: A total of 14 case-control studies were included, with 2,743 cases in the case group and 4,320 in the control group.

      "problem_en": "Management after ingestion of a foreign object\n\nIn daily life, sometimes we may accidentally swallow some foreign objects, such as jackfruit seeds. This situation is common, but improper handling may cause discomfort or even health problems. Here, we detail the proper management after ingestion of a foreign object and dietary recommendations.\n\nManagement after ingestion of a foreign object\n1. Assess the size and shape of the foreign object: First, assess the size and shape of the swallowed foreign object. If the object is larger than a coin, it can usually pass through naturally. But if the object is too large or has a sharp shape, it may get lodged in the gastrointestinal tract, causing discomfort or even intestinal obstruction.\n2. Observe bodily responses: After swallowing a foreign object, you should closely observe the body's responses. If symptoms such as bloating, indigestion, or abdominal pain occur, seek medical attention promptly.\n3. Promote digestion and excretion: To help the object pass through, you can eat more foods rich in dietary fiber, such as garlic chives and celery. Dietary fiber helps increase intestinal peristalsis, promoting digestion and excretion.\n\nDietary recommendations\n1. Normal diet: After foreign object ingestion, maintain a normal diet; there is no need to deliberately eat more or less. A normal diet helps maintain normal intestinal function.\n2. Avoid constipation: If you are prone to constipation, pay particular attention to your diet, eat more fiber-rich foods, and drink more water to prevent constipation.\n3. Pharmacologic assistance: If you experience bloating or indigestion, you may take some digestive aid medications in moderation, such as domperidone.\n\nSpecial precautions\n1. Role of gastric acid: Gastric acid can help digest part of a foreign object, but not all foreign bodies can be fully digested by gastric acid. Therefore, you should not rely entirely on gastric acid to manage swallowed foreign objects.\n2. Seek medical attention promptly: If the ingested object is large or sharp, or if you develop severe symptoms, seek immediate medical attention to avoid serious conditions such as intestinal obstruction.\n\nIn sum, after ingesting a foreign object, you do not need to panic, but you should not be careless either. Correct handling methods and dietary recommendations can help you better cope with this situation. If you experience any discomfort, seek medical attention promptly.",

Below we provide a detailed overview of the proper management after ingesting foreign bodies and dietary recommendations.\n\n#### Management after Ingesting a Foreign Body\n\n1. **Size** and **Shape**\n- **Size**: If the ingested object is slightly larger than a coin, it can usually pass naturally. For example, if you accidentally swallow a small stone, most of the time it will pass with the food.\n- **Shape**: But if the object is too large or has a sharp shape, such as a long needle or a large piece of bone, it may get stuck in the digestive tract, causing discomfort or even intestinal obstruction. Imagine how painful and dangerous it would be if a sharp toothpick got stuck in your throat.\n\n2. **Monitor Body Reactions**\n- After ingesting a foreign body, you should closely monitor the body's responses. If you experience symptoms such as bloating, indigestion, or abdominal pain, seek medical attention promptly. For example, if you feel abdominal pain after eating bone, this may indicate the bone is lodged in the digestive tract and requires medical assistance.\n\n3. **Promoting Digestion and Excretion**\n- To help the foreign object pass smoothly, you can eat more foods rich in cellulose, such as garlic chives and celery. Cellulose helps increase intestinal peristalsis, promoting digestion and excretion. Cellulose is like a small broom, helping to clear foreign bodies from the gut.\n\n#### Dietary Advice\n\n1. **Normal Diet**\n- After ingesting a foreign object, you should maintain a normal diet; there is no need to deliberately eat more or less. Normal eating helps maintain the normal function of the intestines. Just as usual, eat on time and don't become overly anxious because of the foreign object.\n\n2. **Avoid Constipation**\n- If you are prone to constipation, pay particular attention to your diet, eat more foods rich in cellulose, and drink more water to prevent constipation. Constipation makes it harder for the foreign body to be expelled, like a muddy road hindering car movement.\n\n3. **Medication Support**\n- If you experience bloating or indigestion, you may take modest amounts of digestive aids, such as metoclopramide. These medications can help relieve discomfort and make you feel more comfortable.\n\n#### Special Precautions\n\n1. **Role of Gastric Acid**\n- Gastric acid can help digest some foreign objects, but not all foreign objects can be completely digested by gastric acid. Therefore, you should not rely entirely on gastric acid to handle ingested foreign objects. While gastric acid is powerful, it cannot digest a blade.\n\n2. **Seek Medical Attention Promptly**\n- If the ingested foreign object is large or sharp, or if you experience severe symptoms, seek medical attention immediately to avoid serious conditions such as intestinal obstruction. Just as when you encounter a problem, seek professional help and do not wait until the issue worsens.\n\n#### Summary\n\nIngesting foreign objects does not require excessive panic, but you should not take it lightly either. Correct handling methods and dietary recommendations can help you better cope with this situation. If you feel unwell, seek medical attention promptly. Remember, health always comes first; do not overlook bigger problems because of small issues.",

Its colonies are round with even edges, smooth, milky white, and non‑hemolytic.\n\nAlthough this bacterium can colonize healthy human skin, nails, and nasal mucosa, it remains a rare human pathogen and is not generally considered to have the same virulence as coagulase‑positive Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nPathogenic mechanisms include:\n(1) an autolysin or fibronectin‑binding protein encoded by the altC gene that enables adhesion to human tissues;\n(2) expression of the ica operon, which promotes biofilm formation on bones, orthopedic devices, and catheters, helping it evade immune attack and antibiotics.\n\nPredisposing factors include diabetes, foreign body implantation, cancer, chronic kidney failure, obesity, open or traumatic fractures, and contact with sheep or goats.\n\nIn immunocompromised inpatients, especially those with goat exposure who recently underwent orthopedic surgery, this organism can cause osteoarticular infections, meningitis, and urinary tract infections.\n\nSeng et al. conducted a pooled analysis of 25 cases of goat Staphylococcus–related bone and joint infections; only up to 20% had close exposure to goats or sheep, while the rest were nosocomial infections.\n\nGoat Staphylococcus can also cause peritonitis, recurrent septicemia, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and pericarditis; infective endocarditis is relatively rare. Endocarditis pathogens are mainly Staphylococcus aureus and viridans group streptococci, and blood cultures remain an important method for diagnosing bacteremia and infective endocarditis.\n\nWith ongoing advances, more pathogens are recognized as causes of infective endocarditis.

      "answer_en": "Staphylococcus caprae is a microorganism that was first isolated in 1983 from the milk of goats with mastitis. Its colonies are circular, with neat margins, smooth surfaces, milky white in color, and non-hemolytic. Although it is commonly found on the skin, nails, and noses of healthy people, it seldom causes disease, unlike the common pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nThere are two ways it can cause disease: first, it can produce cytolytic substances that adhere to human tissues; second, it can form biofilms on bones, orthopedic implants, and catheters, protecting it from the immune system and from drugs.\n\nConditions associated with infection by Staphylococcus caprae include diabetes mellitus, foreign body implantation, cancer, kidney disease, obesity, bone injury, and exposure to goats or sheep. In hospitals, immunocompromised patients, especially those who have touched goats and have recently undergone orthopedic surgery, may develop osteoarticular infections, meningitis, urinary tract infections, etc., due to this bacterium. Sometimes, even without direct contact with goats, infection can occur in hospital settings.\n\nIt can also cause peritonitis, recurrent sepsis, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and pericarditis, among other conditions, but rarely infective endocarditis. Infective endocarditis is most often caused by Staphylococcus aureus and viridans group streptococci, and blood cultures can rapidly diagnose bacteremia and infective endocarditis. As medical technology advances, more species of bacteria have been found to cause this disease. There is a new technique called pathogen metagenomic next-generation sequencing, which can rapidly and accurately identify these rare bacteria.

      "problem_en": "3. Pathogenesis and Pathological Changes\n(1) Pathogenesis\nInfluenza A and B viruses initiate infection by binding to sialic acid receptors on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells via hemagglutinin (HA). The virus enters host cells by endocytosis, and its genome is transcribed and replicated in the nucleus, producing a large number of new progeny viruses that infect other cells. After infection, severe cases can trigger a cytokine storm, leading to sepsis, which in turn causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, encephalopathy, and multiple organ dysfunction among other complications.\n\n(2) Pathological Changes\nThe main changes include clustered shedding of ciliated respiratory epithelium, epithelial squamous metaplasia, congestion and edema of mucosal cells in the lamina propria with mononuclear cell infiltration. In severe cases, pneumonia-like changes can appear; critically ill patients may have concomitant diffuse alveolar damage (DAD); when encephalopathy is present, brain tissue shows diffuse congestion, edema, and necrosis, with acute necrotizing encephalopathy presenting as symmetrical necrotic lesions predominantly in the thalamus; with cardiac involvement, there is interstitial hemorrhage, lymphocytic infiltration, swelling and necrosis of myocardial cells, i.e., myocarditis.",
      "answer_en": "Of course, I will try to explain these medical contents in simple language.\n\n### Section 3: Pathogenesis and Pathological Changes\n\n#### (I) Pathogenesis\n**1. How the virus infects the human body:**\n- **Influenza virus** (especially types A and B) binds to cells on the surface of the human respiratory tract (such as the nose, throat, and lungs) via a surface protein called **hemagglutinin** (HA). These cells have a substance called **sialic acid** on their surfaces, and the virus starts infection by binding to it.\n- Once bound, the virus is internalized into the cell, and the viral genetic material (**genome**) replicates and produces new viruses in the cell nucleus. These new viruses go on to infect other cells, spreading the infection.\n\n**2. Severe consequences of viral infection:**\n- In some severe cases, influenza virus can trigger an excessive immune response, producing large amounts of cytokines (an immune signaling molecule), a phenomenon called **cytokine storm**. The cytokine storm can lead to a severe inflammatory response and may trigger **sepsis**, a systemic inflammatory response to infection, which can lead to multiple serious complications, such as **acute respiratory distress syndrome** (ARDS), shock, brain disorders, and multi-organ failure.\n\n#### (II) Pathological Changes\n**1. Changes in the respiratory tract:**\n- Viral infection causes the ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory tract (which help clear dust and microorganisms) to desquamate and disappear in clusters. In addition, epithelial cells may undergo abnormal changes (metaplasia); the blood vessels in the respiratory tract become congested and edematous, with a large infiltration of mononuclear cells (a type of white blood cell); these are manifestations of an inflammatory response.\n\n**2. Changes in severe cases:**\n- **Pneumonia**: severe cases may develop pneumonia, i.e., inflammation of the lungs.\n- **Diffuse alveolar damage**: in the most severe cases, alveoli (the small sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs) are extensively damaged.\n- **Encephalopathy**: if the virus affects the brain, it may cause widespread congestion, edema, and necrosis of brain tissue. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy is a particularly severe brain injury, characterized by symmetric necrosis of the thalamus, a key part of the brain.\n- **Cardiac injury**: the virus can also cause heart problems, such as myocarditis (inflammation of the myocardium), manifested as hemorrhage in cardiac tissue, lymphocytic infiltration, cardiomyocyte swelling, and necrosis.\n\nI hope these explanations help you better understand the pathogenesis and pathological changes of influenza.

      "problem_en": "- Patient Liu ××, female, 72 years old. She has a 15-year history of chronic cough, exertional dyspnea for more than 10 years, and recurrent bilateral leg edema for six months. One week ago, after a cold, cough and dyspnea worsened, with yellow sputum, no fever; bilateral leg edema recurred. She self-administered diuretics for one week, with no obvious improvement, and was admitted for further diagnosis and treatment. Past history includes duodenal bulb ulcer for 6 years and gallstone disease for 5 years. On admission, physical examination: alert, dyspneic, lips mildly cyanotic. Jugular venous distension, barrel-shaped chest. Percussion of both lungs hyperresonant. Breath sounds reduced; scattered fine crackles in both lungs, more pronounced on the right. Cardiac silhouette slightly enlarged to the left; apical impulse palpable at the left edge of the sternum’s lower border; heart sounds dull with variable intensity; heart rate 100 bpm; atrial fibrillation. Systolic murmur at the apex, grade 2/6, increases with inspiration, does not radiate to the axilla. Abdomen soft; liver palpable 2 cm below the costal margin; below the xiphoid process 3 cm; no tenderness; positive hepatojugular reflux. Clubbing present. Bilateral lower limbs with Grade I pitting edema. ECG: atrial fibrillation, low voltage, P waves of the pulmonary type, QRS axis to the right. Laboratory and other tests: red blood cells 5.5 × 10^12/L, hemoglobin 160 g/L; white blood cells 8.9 × 10^9/L; neutrophils 0.89, lymphocytes 0.10, eosinophils 0.01. Chest X-ray: increased lucency of both lung fields, irregular lung markings, cardiac silhouette slightly enlarged to the left. Preliminary diagnoses: acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with emphysema; chronic cor pulmonale; decompensated chronic heart failure (cardiac function class III); arrhythmia (persistent atrial fibrillation); duodenal bulb ulcer; gallstones.\n\n- Plant photodermatitis patients typically develop linear or bizarrely shaped erythema, swelling, and large blisters in sun-exposed skin areas, with shapes reflecting how the patient came into contact with plants. For example, patients who developed plant photodermatitis after contact with grasses and field plants usually have linear rash distributions. Clinical manifestations appear about 24 hours after sun exposure. Lesions are non-pruritic and may be painful. As the acute eruption subsides, hyperpigmentation occurs, which may take months to years to fade. It should be noted that the initial erythema is often not obvious; hyperpigmentation is usually what is observed.\n\n- Plant photodermatitis = skin contact with certain plants followed by sun exposure leads to some oddly shaped red patches, swellings, or blisters. These shapes reflect how the skin contacted the plant. For example, after playing on grass, linear red patches may appear on the skin. These symptoms typically appear about 24 hours after sun exposure. Although not itchy, they may be slightly painful. As the acute symptoms fade, the skin becomes darker, and this dark coloration may take several months to several years to fade. In the beginning, the redness may be faint, and people usually notice only the darkening of the skin.\n\n- History of present illness: The patient, male, 23 years old, presents with neck pain when turning his head, a pain akin to a stiff neck, accompanied by pleuritic-like pain and lasting several months. The patient reports that pressing on the neck does not produce pain. He generally has poor appetite and digestion, tends to overthink, feels that qi is not moving smoothly, and is unsure whether this is related to neck pain. He has never undergone medical evaluation for this symptom. He exercises regularly and denies cervical spine problems. Abdominal circumference 90 cm. Visual inspection: abdomen flat, no distension, no visible abdominal contours such as distension, no abdominal wall varices, no hernias or localized protrusions (location, size, contour). Palpation: abdomen soft; no tenderness, rebound tenderness, or fluid wave; no abdominal masses. Liver not palpable; Gallbladder: non-tender, Murphy’s sign negative; Spleen not palpable; Kidneys not palpable; Bladder not distended; Ureteral points non-tender. Percussion: liver dullness upper border at the right midclavicular line (5th intercostal space), at the right midaxillary line (7th intercostal space), at the right scapular line (10th intercostal space); liver dullness boundary present; no tenderness in hepatic region; no tenderness in renal region; no shifting dullness; gastric bubble tympany present. Auscultation: bowel sounds present with no borborygmi; no vascular murmurs heard.\n\n- Tug sign is a variant sign during skeletal development. In bone growth, excessive tendon traction stimulates local osteoblast activity, forming bony outgrowths. These outgrowths are typically bird-beak-like, cap-like, or blunt-needle-shaped, facing away from the knee joint. The tug sign occurs at tendon attachment points; the base is broad and continuous with the long bone cortex, with no clear boundary.\n\n- Output:\n- Tug sign is an uncommon variation seen during skeletal development. During bone growth, if the tendon pulls too hard, it stimulates osteoblasts at a specific bone site to become highly active, leading to a bony protrusion. This protrusion is often shaped like a bird’s beak, a small cap, or a blunt spur, and points away from the knee joint. The tug sign generally occurs at the tendon insertion site; its base is broad and continuous with the surrounding long bone structure, with no clear demarcation.\n\n- Admission physical examination: Alert, dyspneic, lips mildly cyanotic.

      "answer_en": "The pumping ability of the heart's largest left-sided chamber (the left ventricle) appears normal (ejection fraction greater than 50%), but in fact the heart is still experiencing problems. This condition is called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This disease causes the heart's relaxation and contraction to be somewhat abnormal, and blood pressure may also be abnormal.

      "problem_en": "Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae. They are segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses. Based on viral nucleoprotein and matrix protein, they are divided into four types: A, B, C, and D (A, B, C, D) [24]. Based on differences in surface hemagglutinin (hemagglutinin, HA) and neuraminidase (neuraminidase, NA), influenza A viruses can be divided into multiple subtypes [24]. Currently causing seasonal influenza outbreaks globally and in China are the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B Victoria and Yamagata lineages. Each year seasonal influenza outbreaks worldwide can lead to 3–5 million cases of severe illness and 290,000–650,000 respiratory-disease–related deaths [25]. There is no cross-immunity between different influenza virus types and subtypes; populations can be reinfected and become ill. In each influenza season, the infection rate in children is 20%–30%, and during outbreak seasons, child infection rates can be as high as about 50% [25]. A systematic retrospective study of influenza prevalence (including both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections) suggests that the prevalence among those under 18 years is about 22.5%, while among adults it is about 10.7% [26]. Compared with other groups, school-aged children have the highest influenza infection rate, especially early in the influenza season when most cases occur in school-aged children; moreover, after infection children shed the virus for a longer period, so children play an important role in the sustained circulation and transmission of influenza in communities, schools, and households [27].",
      "answer_en": "Influenza viruses are a special type of virus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family, composed of single-stranded negative-sense RNA and are segmented. This virus can be divided into four types based on its nucleoprotein and matrix protein: A, B, C, D. And type A influenza virus can also be further subdivided into many subtypes according to differences in two surface proteins—hemagglutinin and neuraminidase.\n\nCurrently, the main circulating influenza viruses globally and in our country during each annual flu season are four: the 2009 novel influenza A H1N1, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B Victoria lineage and Yamagata lineage. Each year, a large number of people become ill with influenza, roughly 3 million to 5 million severe cases, and as many as 290,000 to 650,000 deaths due to influenza-related respiratory diseases.\n\nThe most troublesome thing is that there is no cross-immunity between different types of influenza viruses, so people can get influenza repeatedly. Each year during influenza season, the proportion of children who get influenza is particularly high, about 20% to 30%, and during major influenza outbreaks this proportion can reach about 50%. One study reported that the rate among children under 18 is about 22.5%, while for adults it is 10.7%.\n\nCompared with others, school-age children have the highest probability of getting influenza, especially at the early stage of influenza activity; most of those infected are these children. Moreover, after children contract influenza, the time to clear the virus is longer. Therefore, in communities, schools, and homes, children play a major role in the ongoing transmission and spread of influenza.",

      "problem_en": "The traditional definition of hypereosinophilic syndrome is persistent peripheral blood eosinophilia >1500/μL (>1.5 × 10^9/L) for ≥6 months with evidence of organ dysfunction. (See eosinophil formation and function.) Hypereosinophilic syndrome has historically been considered idiopathic, but molecular features show that many cases have specific clonal diseases (1). A limitation of the traditional definition is that it does not include some patients who have the same abnormalities (such as genetic defects) that are known etiologies of hypereosinophilic syndrome but whose degree and duration of eosinophilia do not meet the traditional criteria. Another limitation is that some patients with eosinophilia and organ damage characteristic of hypereosinophilic syndrome require treatment before they clearly meet the traditional diagnostic criteria of 6 months. Eosinophilia of any cause can lead to the same type of tissue damage.\n\nOther variants of hypereosinophilic syndrome include Gleich syndrome (episodic angioedema with eosinophilia), familial hypereosinophilic syndrome localized to 5q31-33, and other organ-specific syndromes. In organ-specific hypereosinophilic syndromes, eosinophilic infiltration is confined to a single organ (e.g., eosinophilic gastroenteritis, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia—3). Patients with eosinophilic leukemia may present with marked leukocytosis, and eosinophil counts can be very high (e.g., >100,000 cells/μL [>100 × 10^9/L]). Eosinophils can form aggregates, occluding small vessels and causing tissue ischemia and microinfarcts. Common manifestations include hypoxemia affecting the brain or lungs (e.g., encephalopathy, dyspnea or respiratory failure). Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is rare, with unknown incidence, most commonly affecting people aged 20 to 50 years. Only some patients with long-standing hypereosinophilia develop organ dysfunction, which characterizes the condition. Although any organ can be affected, the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, skin, and nervous system are mainly involved. Cardiac involvement may be associated with higher morbidity and mortality.",
      "answer_en": "Hypereosinophilic syndrome is typically defined as a sustained eosinophil count in the blood exceeding the normal level (1500/µL) for at least six months, accompanied by organ dysfunction.\nIn the past, this syndrome was considered idiopathic, but now many cases are found to be associated with specific genetic abnormalities.\nThe traditional definition has some shortcomings, such as not including patients who, although having the same genetic defect, do not meet the eosinophil count and duration criteria.\nIn addition, some patients require treatment before reaching the six-month traditional diagnostic threshold because they have already developed organ damage.\nEosinophilia of any etiology may cause similar tissue damage.\nThere are also other types of eosinophilia, such as Gleich syndrome, which causes angioedema, and some familial syndromes associated with specific genes.\nIn some cases, eosinophils affect only a single organ, such as the gastrointestinal tract or the lungs.\nIn eosinophilic leukemia, the white blood cell count can be very high, such as >100,000 cells/µL.\nEosinophils can accumulate and occlude small vessels, leading to tissue ischemia and microinfarcts, presenting as hypoxia of the brain or lungs.\nIdiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is relatively rare, typically occurring in people aged 20 to 50 years, with only a minority of patients developing organ dysfunction, primarily affecting the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, skin, and nervous system, and cardiac involvement may be associated with higher morbidity and mortality.",

She presented to the Department of Dentistry at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in November 2023. Chief complaint: progressive loss of multiple teeth over more than 10 years in the entire dentition, seeking dental restoration. Family members reported that the patient had previously undergone removable partial denture restorations for both the maxilla and mandible, but she perceived poor retention and stability and did not wear them. All maxillary teeth were missing one year ago.\n\nCurrent medications: Madopar tablets 5–6 times/day, 1/8–1/4 tablet per dose; ropinirole extended-release tablets 2 mg, once daily. Each dose’s effect lasts 70–80 minutes; when mood is favorable, the effect lasts 2–3 hours. The patient’s condition in the afternoon is poor.\n\nFunctional status and daily living: The patient is unable to care for herself, unable to stand independently; unable to feed herself, relying on others to feed liquids with a spoon and to administer water with a syringe; swallowing is slow and prone to choking. In the past 3 years, family and caregivers have prepared tongue retrievers, whistles, respiratory trainers, and silicone bite blocks for daily use, with these devices used by the patient twice daily, each session lasting about 30 minutes. Including: ① Tongue retriever to pull the tongue outward and to move it left and right; after pulling the tongue outward, instruct the patient to retract the tongue for resistance training; ② whistle and respiratory trainer; ③ silicone bite blocks placed on the alveolar ridge of the anterior missing tooth area; ④ counting training. The family reports that three years ago the tongue was nearly immobile; after tongue retriever training, tongue muscle strength improved compared with before; the patient could not whistle; presently able to count from 1 to 50; occlusion and choking have not shown obvious improvement.\n\nClinical and imaging examination: The patient was brought to the consultation room in a wheelchair. General condition is poor. Response is slow, voice is monotone; able to respond to monosyllabic or disyllabic words. When speaking, the jaw and lips show mild tremor; other facial muscles are nearly immobile. Blink rate is reduced, ocular movements are reduced. Bilateral temporomandibular joints show no tenderness and no crepitus. Facial muscles are rigid, vertical facial height is increased. Perioral muscles are tense. Intraoral examination shows an edentulous maxilla, a pointed-oval dental arch, moderate alveolar ridge resorption, and pink mucosa. Saliva production is reduced; the floor of the mouth saliva pool is absent. The entire mouth retains only teeth 33–35 and 44. Tooth 44 is mobility II; teeth 33–35 are mobility I, with extensive cervical caries. Periapical radiographs show alveolar bone resorption around tooth 44 to the apex; alveolar bone resorption around teeth 33–35 to the middle third of the roots; and low-density lesions at the cervical regions of teeth 34 and 35.",

      "problem_en": "China Expert Consensus on Antiviral Therapy and Prevention of Seasonal Influenza\n\nI need to write a medical paper, the title is about a discussion on the use of antiviral drugs for seasonal influenza. Please help me generate the introduction of the paper based on the following content; the word count should not exceed 300 words.\n\nSeasonal Influenza Antiviral Therapy and Prevention: China Expert Consensus\n\nSeasonal influenza (hereafter referred to as influenza) viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and are mostly spherical particles. They are classified into types A, B, and C according to nucleoprotein and matrix protein antigens. Influenza A viruses are subdivided into multiple subtypes based on differences in surface hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA); to date, 16 HA subtypes (H1–H16) and 9 NA subtypes (N1–N9) have been identified. The subtypes most prevalent in humans are A/H1N1 and A/H3N2. Influenza B and C viruses each have only one antigenic type, and their host range is limited, with fewer pandemics. The most notable epidemiological features of influenza are: sudden outbreaks, rapid spread, causing varying degrees of epidemics, seasonality, and high incidence. Globally each year, 5%–10% of adults and 20%–30% of children contract influenza. Most influenza patients recover, but some develop severe complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, or myocarditis. It is estimated that worldwide each year there are 3–5 million cases of severe influenza, leading to 250,000–500,000 deaths. China’s burden of seasonal influenza shows that from 2003 to 2008, the excess mortality due to influenza in northern and southern China was 18.0110 ten thousand and 11.3 per 10,000, respectively, with deaths from respiratory and circulatory diseases accounting for 49.2% and 46.2%. In 2009, a global outbreak of novel influenza A(H1N1) occurred; among hospitalized patients, 40%–66% had radiographic evidence of pneumonia, of whom 22.9%–42.0% progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); the in-hospital case fatality rate among all admissions ranged from 2.7% to 11.0%. In recent years, China has also experienced outbreaks of H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza; as of February 23, 2015, China had reported 571 laboratory-confirmed human cases of influenza A(H7N9), with 212 deaths (41%). There have also been reports of sporadic infections with H10N8 and H5N6 avian influenza viruses, most of which were severe. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on novel influenza A(H1N1) influenza and other antiviral drug interventions, together with China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission’s “Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Seasonal Influenza (2011 edition)” and the “Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Human Infection with H7N9 Avian Influenza (2014 edition),” all recommend and emphasize early antiviral therapy for influenza. However, given the current endemicity and frequency of severe cases, early diagnosis and antiviral treatment strategies in clinical practice remain unclear, especially for high-risk populations such as infants and young children, pregnant women, the elderly (age ≥65), and severely ill patients, for whom standardized treatment strategies are lacking. Therefore, the Chinese Thoracic Society’s Respiratory Disease Branch and the Chinese Pediatric Society organized experts to draft this consensus to standardize the use of antiviral drugs in the treatment and prevention of influenza.",

"根据以下内容生成一篇论文提纲，内容是关于咳嗽患儿诊疗用药需注意的事项。提纲需要包括【论文题目】【摘要】【关键词】【引言】【正文章节目录及每章对应的内容概要】【结论】【参考文献】\n临床问题1：咳嗽患儿如何合理使用祛痰药和镇咳药？\n\n推荐意见1：不推荐咳嗽患儿常规使用祛痰药和镇咳药（1A）。\n\n推荐意见2：建议对湿性咳嗽、痰液阻塞、咳痰费力、影响生活和学习时，可在权衡疗效与安全性后酌情选择适宜的祛痰药；对剧烈或频繁的干性咳嗽、影响生活和学习时，首要是明确病因，并可根据具体情况酌情短期使用镇咳药缓解症状（GPS）。\n\n祛痰药和镇咳药在儿童咳嗽的治疗中使用普遍，基层临床实践中，祛痰药和镇咳药的广泛使用乃出自患儿家长的担忧以及对改善患儿生活质量的迫切需要。咳嗽治疗中祛痰药和镇咳药的有效性缺乏严格的循证医学证据，临床上也存在一定的不合理用药现象。\n\n祛痰药可分为黏液溶解剂、黏液动力促进剂、黏液调节剂、痰液清除剂，其机制包括降低黏液黏度、改善黏液清除动力学、减少气道分泌物产生、增加黏液量使痰液易于咳出。尚缺乏祛痰药治疗儿童急性咳嗽有效性和安全性的研究报道，不同国家对祛痰药使用推荐存在很大差异，欧洲药品管理局不推荐2岁以下儿童使用祛痰药，加拿大和比利时不推荐6岁以下儿童使用。一项系统评价显示乙酰半胱氨酸和羧甲司坦祛痰剂对2岁以上儿童急性呼吸道感染所致咳嗽的疗效有限。另一项系统评价发现黏液溶解剂联合抗菌药物较对照组（抗菌药物联合安慰剂）治疗儿童肺炎的主要结局差异无统计学意义。因此不推荐咳嗽患儿常规使用祛痰药，尤其对2岁以下儿童需更加谨慎。\n\n镇咳药治疗儿童咳嗽的有效性证据不足，且可能导致多种不良反应，严重时可引起死亡，故不推荐常规使用。多项系统评价提示右美沙芬治疗儿童咳嗽的效果与蜂蜜或安慰剂相比差异无统计学意义。也有小样本随机对照试验（randomized controlled trial，RCT）（128例）提示，右美沙芬较安慰剂可显著减少6~11岁感冒患儿的24 h内总咳嗽次数和日间咳嗽频率。\n\n临床实践中，建议可根据患儿具体情况（年龄、咳嗽的性质、病程、严重程度、具体病因、用药后的改善效果等）谨慎合理使用祛痰药，如迁延性细菌性支气管炎（protracted bacterial bronchitis，PBB）等化脓性肺疾病可使用雾化吸入N-乙酰半胱氨酸，具体选用原则可参照相关指导性文件。需要注意的是西药（复方感冒药）、中药和中西药合剂种类繁多，常含有相同成分，联合用药可导致重复或过量用药，增加不良反应的风险。临床上应严格掌握适应证和禁忌证，做到安全合理用药。\n\n临床问题2：咳嗽患儿是否需要使用抗组胺药治疗？\n\n推荐意见3：不推荐急性咳嗽患儿常规使用抗组胺药治疗（1B）。\n\n推荐意见4：对于伴有明显流涕、鼻塞、打喷嚏的急性咳嗽患儿，可尝试酌情短期谨慎使用第1代抗组胺药联合减充血剂治疗2~3 d观察疗效，如有效则可用至5 d（GPS）。\n\n推荐意见5：对于变应性鼻炎引起的上气道咳嗽综合征（upper airway cough syndrome，UACS）患儿，推荐口服第2代抗组胺药（1B）。\n\n抗组胺药可分为第1代药物（包括苯海拉明、氯苯那敏、赛庚啶、酮替芬、曲普利啶等）和第2代药物（包括西替利嗪、左西替利嗪、氯雷他定、地氯雷他定、依巴斯汀、氮卓斯汀等）。第1代药物为传统抗组胺药，易透过血脑屏障，具有抗胆碱作用，有助于减少呼吸道分泌物，且具有一定中枢镇咳作用，因此经典复方感冒药常含有第1代抗组胺药成分；然而其会造成一些不良反应，常见不良反应包括嗜睡、乏力、口干等。第2代抗组胺药可特异性作用于外周H1受体，不易透过血脑屏障，在中枢神经系统的不良反应较第1代药物减少；但因几乎无抗胆碱作用，不用于缓解咳嗽症状。第2代新型抗组胺药的不良反应及与其他药物如肝酶抑制剂的相互作用发生概率也更低。\n\n一项系统评价发现苯海拉明在降低咳嗽频率、缓解咳嗽严重程度和改善儿童睡眠等方面的有效性劣于蜂蜜。另一项系统评价发现没有证据支持口服抗组胺药-减充血剂-镇痛药治疗普通感冒有效，其中纳入的两项儿童人群研究表明抗组胺药-减充血剂治疗儿童急性咳嗽与安慰剂相比差异无统计学意义。因此，不推荐急性咳嗽患儿常规使用抗组胺药治疗；但对于伴有明显流涕、鼻塞、打喷嚏的急性咳嗽患儿，可尝试酌情短期谨慎使用第1代抗组胺药联合减充血剂治疗，2~3 d后观察疗效，如有效则可用至5 d。\n\nUACS是指由上气道疾病如各种鼻炎、鼻窦炎、慢性咽炎、腺样体肥大等引起的鼻腔分泌物增多并倒流至咽部，直接或间接刺激咳嗽感受器，导致以咳嗽为主要表现的临床综合征。变应性鼻炎是引起儿童UACS的常见疾病之一。系统评价发现，第2代抗组胺药可有效控制变应性鼻炎的症状，且在儿童人群耐受良好。一项RCT表明使用第2代抗组胺药（包括氯雷他定和左西替利嗪）可以减轻变应性鼻炎的症状。针对变应性鼻炎引起的儿童UACS，第2代抗组胺药是对因治疗。\n\n临床问题3：慢性非特异性咳嗽患儿是否需要使用白三烯受体拮抗剂（leukotriene receptor antagonists，LTRA）治疗？\n\n推荐意见6：不建议慢性非特异性咳嗽患儿常规使用LTRA治疗（2B）。\n\n推荐意见7：对于考虑与哮喘、咳嗽变异性哮喘或变应性鼻炎有关的慢性咳嗽，建议可酌情选用LTRA治疗（2B）。\n\n白三烯是花生四烯酸经5-脂氧酶代谢途径形成的脂质炎性介质，可引起气道平滑肌收缩，增加血管通透性，促进气道黏液分泌，促进嗜酸粒细胞的趋化等。LTRA通过竞争性结合白三烯受体发挥抗炎作用，在哮喘、咳嗽变异性哮喘、变应性鼻炎的防治中已得到广泛应用。然而，LTRA并非传统镇咳药，在临床实践中LTRA在治疗慢性非特异性咳嗽中存在过度使用及超说明书用药现象。我国开展的多中心研究显示，LTRA在儿童慢性咳嗽用药中高居首位。一项针对12 809份门诊儿童处方的抽样调查研究发现，孟鲁司特超说明书用药率高达94.04%，其中排第3位的超适应证用药诊断为咳嗽。LTRA的广泛使用可能是由于其为非激素类抗炎药，给药方便、依从性好、不良反应相对较少，容易被患儿和家长接受。\n\n然而，尚无足够证据表明LTRA对于儿童慢性非特异性咳嗽有益。LTRA引起不良反应的潜在风险也限制了其应用。一项系统评价分析了LTRA治疗慢性非特异性咳嗽患儿的安全性和有效性，结果仅2项研究符合纳入标准，其中一项无法单独提取慢性非特异性咳嗽患儿数据，另一项研究因纳入患者数量过少（6例）而无法得出结论。由于缺乏证据，韩国变态反应与临床免疫学会和欧洲呼吸学会咳嗽指南也均不推荐LTRA治疗儿童慢性非特异性咳嗽。2020年美国食品药品监督管理局发布了关于孟鲁司特的药品安全信息警告，警示在使用期间需要注意监测精神方面如睡眠障碍、失眠、易怒、幻觉、抑郁等的不良反应。对于考虑与哮喘、咳嗽变异性哮喘或变应性鼻炎有关的慢性咳嗽，可酌情选用LTRA治疗，但需定期随访咳嗽症状，明确病因，调整用药。基层临床实践需注意减少LTRA过度使用，并加强不良反应监测，保证合理用药。\n\n临床问题4：咳嗽患儿是否需要常规使用抗菌药物？当有使用抗菌药物指征时，推荐何种抗菌药物？\n\n推荐意见8：不推荐急性咳嗽患儿常规使用抗菌药物（1A）。\n\n推荐意见9：当临床考虑细菌感染需要使用抗菌药物时，建议首选口服阿莫西林或阿莫西林-克拉维酸钾，常规疗程为5~7 d。当存在青霉素过敏或药物可及性问题时，可选用口服二代头孢菌素或大环内酯类抗菌药物（2C）。\n\n推荐意见10：对临床考虑百日咳或肺炎支原体、衣原体感染的患儿，推荐首选大环内酯类抗菌药物（1B）。\n\n推荐意见11：对不伴有提示其他诊断的特异症状或体征的慢性湿性咳嗽患儿，在积极寻找病因的前提下，可经验性使用抗菌药物治疗；首选口服阿莫西林-克拉维酸钾（7∶1~14∶1）25~30 mg/（kg·次）（按阿莫西林剂量计算），每12小时1次，并予观察、等待和随访。若考虑为PBB，疗程至少2周（1B）。\n\n儿童急性咳嗽通常是由病毒感染引起，具有自限性。早期使用抗菌药物并不能减轻咳嗽和其他症状或缩短病程，反而会导致药物不良反应和诱导细菌耐药，因此不予常规推荐。一项系统评价发现，延迟使用（至少延迟48 h）、立即使用和不使用抗菌药物3种策略在呼吸道感染患者（主要为儿童）的咳嗽症状缓解、复诊率、替代药物使用率方面差异均无统计学意义；相对于立即使用组，延迟使用组抗菌药物使用率明显较少（OR=0.03，95%CI 0.01~0.07），且二者在患者满意度、并发症发生率方面差异均无统计学意义。回顾性研究发现急性支气管炎初发时使用抗菌药物，随后再次发生急性支气管炎的风险（HR=1.23，95%CI 1.17~1.30）更高，再次发作时使用抗菌药物的风险（HR=2.13，95%CI 1.99~2.28）更高。因此，应严格把握急性咳嗽初次使用抗菌药物的指征。\n\n当急性咳嗽病程迁延或症状加重，或出现咳脓痰、外周血白细胞计数、中性粒细胞百分比或炎症指标升高时，尤其对于有基础疾病的患儿，需要考虑细菌感染的可能，并根据可能的病原体经验性使用抗菌药物治疗。一项RCT比较了阿莫西林‐克拉维酸钾和头孢泊肟酯对疑诊细菌性下呼吸道感染患儿的疗效，结果显示两组在疗效（治愈或改善）（96.7%比95.2%，P>0.05）和不良反应方面（7%比3.9%，P>0.05）差异均无统计学意义。考虑到阿莫西林（或阿莫西林-克拉维酸钾）相对窄谱、价廉、对常见呼吸道感染致病菌敏感，因此在获得药敏试验结果之前，推荐其为首选。本指南专家组认为，当存在青霉素过敏或药物可及性问题时，可选用口服二代头孢菌素或大环内酯类。注意观察随访症状，必要时根据药敏试验结果调整用药。\n\n当急性咳嗽病程迁延，或出现阵发性痉挛性咳嗽、鸡鸣样回声、咳嗽后呕吐等症状时，需考虑百日咳可能。对临床考虑百日咳的患儿推荐尽早（起病后1~2周）使用抗菌药物治疗，首选大环内酯类抗菌药物。一项针对青少年和成人百日咳患者的回顾性队列研究发现，早期给予大环内酯类抗菌药物组（咳嗽发作后11 d内）的咳嗽持续时间明显短于非早期给药组[20.0（95%CI 16~28）比 30.5（95%CI 27~40）d，P=0.002]。对大环内酯类抗菌药物过敏、不耐受或感染耐大环内酯类菌株的2月龄以上患儿可选用复方磺胺甲噁唑作为替代治疗，具体治疗方案可参照“百日咳诊疗方案（2023年版）”。对学龄前期及学龄期患儿，当出现发热、痉挛样咳嗽、早期肺部体征不明显等表现，临床考虑肺炎支原体、衣原体感染时，推荐经验性首选大环内酯类抗菌药物治疗。肺炎支原体肺炎经大环内酯类抗菌药物正规治疗72 h后仍持续发热、临床征象及肺部影像学无改善或加重者考虑大环内酯类药物无反应性肺炎支原体肺炎。在除外混合感染、异常免疫炎症反应后，对于考虑耐药的大环内酯类药物无反应性肺炎支原体肺炎患儿应及时换用新型四环素类抗菌药物或喹诺酮类抗菌药物（据年龄而定），具体治疗方案可参照“儿童肺炎支原体肺炎诊疗指南（2023年版）”。\n\nPBB是引起5岁以下患儿慢性湿性咳嗽的重要病因。PBB患儿若下呼吸道标本病原体培养阳性，且菌落计数≥104菌落形成单位/ml时，称为“基于微生物学诊断的PBB”，以区别于基于临床诊断的PBB。引起PBB的常见病原体包括未分型流感嗜血杆菌、肺炎链球菌和卡他莫拉菌等，均对阿莫西林-克拉维酸钾敏感。一项系统评价发现在儿童慢性湿性咳嗽人群中，使用抗菌药物组“未治愈”或“无明显改善”的患儿较未使用抗菌药物组更低（OR=0.15，95%CI 0.07~0.31）。欧洲呼吸学会指南建议，对胸部X线片、肺功能测定正常且无警示征象的慢性湿性咳嗽儿童可试用抗菌药物治疗。美国胸科医师学会指南指出，对于与基础疾病无关且无任何其他特殊指征（如进食时咳嗽、杵状指）的慢性湿咳患儿，建议使用针对常见呼吸道细菌（肺炎链球菌、流感嗜血杆菌、卡他莫拉菌）的抗菌药物2周。疗程方面，研究显示抗菌药物治疗2周或3~4周在改善慢性湿性咳嗽患儿的临床治愈率（咳嗽消退）、咳嗽的复发率等方面差异均无统计学意义，考虑到长期使用抗菌药物会诱发细菌耐药、可能引起不良反应，故不推荐长期使用抗菌药物，但治疗PBB疗程至少需要2周。药物剂量方面，没有证据表明大剂量阿莫西林[90 mg/（kg·d）]的疗效优于常规剂量，本指南推荐使用阿莫西林25~30 mg/（kg·次），2次/d。使用阿莫西林-克拉维酸钾时，需要注意阿莫西林和克拉维酸钾的比例为7∶1~14∶1，避免因克拉维酸钾过量导致的不良反应。\n\n临床问题5：如何治疗（呼吸道）感染后咳嗽（post-infectious cough，PIC）患儿？\n\n推荐意见12：不推荐PIC患儿常规使用抗菌药物（GPS）。\n\n推荐意见13：在进行鉴别诊断后，对咳嗽剧烈或顽固性咳嗽的PIC患儿，建议可酌情选用吸入性糖皮质激素（inhaled corticosteroid，ICS）或LTRA或支气管舒张剂治疗（2D）。\n\n儿童在急性呼吸道感染后，咳嗽持续超过4周且不足8周，胸部X线片无明显异常或仅发现双肺纹理增多，肺通气功能正常或出现一过性气道高反应，排除其他原因引起的慢性咳嗽后可诊断为PIC。若患儿咳嗽持续超过8周，则PIC可能性小，应考虑其他诊断。引起PIC的病原体众多，但以呼吸道病毒最为常见，因此又常称为“感冒后咳嗽”“呼吸道病毒感染后咳嗽”。PIC具有自限性，通常可自行缓解，抗菌药物并不能减轻咳嗽或缩短病程，反而可能导致药物不良反应和诱导细菌耐药，因此不予常规推荐。对于少部分顽固性咳嗽，在充分与其他引起慢性咳嗽的原因进行鉴别后，若仍考虑到感染因素的存在，必要时可根据病原学结果和药敏试验选择合适的抗菌药物治疗。\n\nPIC的发病机制尚不清楚，被认为是多种因素共同作用，包括上皮完整性的破坏和广泛气道炎症，伴或不伴一过性气道高反应性，黏液分泌过多或清除障碍等。基于此，糖皮质激素、LTRA和支气管舒张剂在临床较为常用。\n\n研究显示吸入丙酸氟替卡松较常规止咳药可显著降低PIC患儿的咳嗽症状评分。体外实验提示，丙酸氟替卡松预处理可显著抑制新型冠状病毒诱导的气道上皮通透性增加，降低血管紧张素转换酶-2的表达。ICS的抗炎作用，能抑制气道释放炎性因子，并降低气道高反应性，一定程度上可改善或缓解新型冠状病毒所致PIC。多项我国开展的RCT提示，孟鲁司特联合ICS和（或）支气管舒张剂治疗可有效改善PIC患儿的治疗总有效率，且安全性良好。我国专家共识指出，对咳嗽症状严重或顽固性咳嗽的PIC患儿建议采取ICS治疗；对于新型冠状病毒感染所致PIC，建议对存在特应性体质感染后存在气道高反应的患儿，可使用ICS、支气管舒张剂及LTRA治疗。因此，本指南专家组建议，在进行鉴别诊断后，对咳嗽剧烈或顽固性咳嗽（常规对症治疗无效）的PIC患儿可使用ICS或LTRA或支气管舒张剂治疗，对特应性体质患儿效果更佳；注意观察疗效，若咳嗽无明显缓解应及时停药，并寻找引起咳嗽的原因。\n\n临床问题6：咳嗽患儿需要警惕哪些急危重症？\n\n推荐意见14：主要包括显性异物吸入、急性喉炎伴喉梗阻、哮喘急性发作（重度或危重度）、重症肺炎、气胸、肺栓塞、左心功能不全等（2D）。\n\n儿童咳嗽病因复杂，有些可能病情轻微，经有效治疗后可迅速好转，但也有可能隐藏了潜在的严重疾病。若没有早期识别潜在的急危重症，可能会耽误最佳治疗时机，造成严重后果。因此具备急危重症的警惕意识和早期识别能力至关重要。\n\n2021年中国成人咳嗽指南提到，急性咳嗽需注意区分是否伴有危重疾病，如急性心肌梗死、左心功能不全、肺炎、气胸、肺栓塞及异物吸入。此外，儿童咳嗽还需警惕喉部疾病导致的喉梗阻、哮喘急性发作（重度或危重度）等急危重症。\n\n显性异物吸入表现为异物吸入时患儿突然出现的刺激性呛咳、憋气、作呕，同时伴有呼吸困难。急性喉炎伴喉梗阻表现为犬吠样咳嗽，伴有吸气性呼吸困难、吸气性喉鸣、声嘶等表现。当急性哮喘发作患儿出现精神意识改变、话不成句、辅助呼吸肌活动及吸气性凹陷、哮鸣音减弱甚至消失等表现时，应警惕重度或危重度哮喘发作。当肺炎患儿出现以下任何一种情况时，可判定为重症肺炎，具体包括一般情况差、意识障碍、低氧血症、发热（超高热、持续高热超过5 d）、脱水征或拒食、胸部X线片或胸部CT异常（≥2/3一侧肺浸润、多叶肺浸润、胸腔积液、气胸、肺不张、肺坏死、肺脓肿）、肺外并发症。气胸和肺栓塞都可表现为咳嗽、呼吸困难、胸痛等，肺栓塞还可表现为咯血，胸部X线片、超声（心脏、肺部、下肢深静脉）、CT肺动脉造影等检查有助于尽早鉴别气胸和肺栓塞。左心衰竭的咳嗽常伴有粉红色泡沫痰，主要原因为左心功能不全导致肺水肿。临床上应注意早期识别急危重症并进行及时治疗或转诊。\n\n临床问题7：儿童咳嗽还可以引起除呼吸系统外的哪些征象？\n\n推荐意见15：剧烈或长期咳嗽可能导致心血管系统、消化系统、肌肉骨骼系统、神经精神系统、皮肤、眼部等肺外系统征象，如心律失常、恶心、呕吐、肌肉骨骼疼痛、肋骨骨折、缺氧性脑损伤、晕厥、失眠、抑郁、皮肤瘀点、紫癜和眼结膜下出血等（2D）。\n\n咳嗽是清除呼吸道过多分泌物和排除异物的有效手段，长期严重咳嗽也可能引起身体和心理的不良事件。了解咳嗽可能引起的肺外表现，有助于加强基层医生理解诊断和治疗咳嗽的必要性，认识到咳嗽对患儿的不良影响，进而更好地提升咳嗽患儿整体生活质量。\n\n2020年一篇概况性评价纳入了286篇文献，对咳嗽相关并发症进行了全面审查，文中提及的儿童咳嗽相关并发症包含缺氧性脑损伤、晕厥、直肠脱垂、贲门黏膜撕裂、纵隔气肿、气管破裂、肺疝、肋骨骨折以及生活质量下降等。对于有合并症的患者，一些并发症可导致严重结局，包括死亡。关于儿童咳嗽导致肺外并发症的研究仍然匮乏，亟待未来开展多中心、大样本的相关发生率及其与咳嗽关联强度的研究。",

The effectiveness of expectorants and antitussives in cough treatment lacks rigorous evidence from evidence-based medicine, and irrational use in clinical practice also exists.\n\nExpectorants can be categorized into mucolytics, mucoactive agents, mucus modulators, and sputum clearance agents; their mechanisms include reducing mucus viscosity, improving mucus clearance dynamics, decreasing airway secretions production, and increasing mucus volume to facilitate coughing up phlegm. There is currently a lack of studies on the efficacy and safety of expectorants for treating pediatric acute cough. Different countries have substantial differences in recommendations for expectorants. The European Medicines Agency does not recommend expectorants for children under 2 years old; Canada and Belgium do not recommend use in children under 6. A systematic review shows that acetylcysteine and carbocisteine have limited efficacy for cough due to acute respiratory infections in children over 2 years old. Another systematic review found that the combination of mucolytics with antibiotics for treating pediatric pneumonia did not yield statistically significant differences in primary outcomes versus control. Therefore, routine use of expectorants for coughing children is not recommended, and special caution is warranted for children under 2 years old.\n\nEvidence on the effectiveness of cough suppressants in children is insufficient and they may cause a range of adverse effects, including potentially fatal outcomes in severe cases; thus they are not routinely recommended. Several systematic reviews suggest that dextromethorphan’s effect on pediatric cough is not statistically different from honey or placebo. There are small randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 128 cases) suggesting that dextromethorphan can significantly reduce total cough frequency and daytime cough in 6–11-year-old children with colds.\n\nIn clinical practice, tailored, cautious, and rational use of expectorants should be considered according to the individual child’s situation (age, cough type, duration, severity, specific etiology, and observed improvement after medication). For protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and purulent pulmonary diseases, inhaled N-acetylcysteine can be used, with selection principles guided by relevant guidance documents. It should be noted that there are many kinds of Western OTC cold medicines, traditional Chinese medicines, and Chinese–Western combined preparations, which often contain similar ingredients; combined use can lead to duplication or overdose and an increased risk of adverse reactions. Clinicians should strictly observe indications and contraindications to ensure safe and rational use.\n\nClinical Question 2: Do coughing children require antihistamines for treatment?\n\nRecommendation 3: Do not routinely use antihistamines to treat acute cough in children (1B).\n\nRecommendation 4: For acute cough children with obvious rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, and sneezing, consider a short-term cautious trial of a first-generation antihistamine combined with a decongestant for 2–3 days to observe efficacy; if effective, continue up to 5 days (GPS).\n\nRecommendation 5: For children with upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) caused by allergic rhinitis, recommend an oral second-generation antihistamine (1B).\n\nAntihistamines are divided into first-generation drugs (including diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, triprolidine, azatadine, cetirizine, etc.) and second-generation drugs (including cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, etc.). First-generation antihistamines are traditional agents that easily cross the blood–brain barrier, possess anticholinergic effects, help reduce respiratory secretions, and have a certain central antitussive effect; thus classic combination cold medicines often contain first-generation antihistamines. However, they cause adverse effects such as drowsiness, fatigue, and dry mouth. Second-generation antihistamines specifically target peripheral H1 receptors, have less CNS adverse effects due to reduced blood–brain barrier penetration, and lack significant anticholinergic effects; they are not used to relieve cough symptoms themselves. Second-generation antihistamines have fewer adverse effects and drug interactions.\n\nA systematic review found that diphenhydramine was less effective than honey in reducing cough frequency, cough severity, and improving sleep in children. Another systematic review found no evidence supporting the efficacy of oral antihistamine–decongestant–antipyretic therapy for common colds; among included pediatric studies, antihistamine–decongestant therapy for acute cough in children did not show a significant difference versus placebo. Therefore, acute cough in children should not be routinely treated with antihistamines; however, for acute cough with obvious rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, and sneezing, a short-term, cautious trial of first-generation antihistamines with a decongestant can be considered for 2–3 days to assess efficacy, and if effective, may be extended to 5 days.\n\nUACS refers to a clinical syndrome caused by upper airway diseases such as various rhinitis, sinusitis, chronic pharyngitis, and adenoidal hypertrophy, leading to increased nasal secretions that drain to the pharynx and stimulate cough receptors. Allergic rhinitis is one of the common causes of pediatric UACS. Systematic reviews show that second-generation antihistamines effectively control allergic rhinitis symptoms and are well tolerated in children. An RCT indicated that second-generation antihistamines (including loratadine and levocetirizine) can alleviate allergic rhinitis symptoms. For allergic rhinitis–related pediatric UACS, second-generation antihistamines are a rational treatment.\n\nClinical Question 3: Should chronic nonspecific cough in children be treated with leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA)?\n\nRecommendation 6: Do not routinely use LTRA to treat chronic nonspecific cough in children (2B).\n\nRecommendation 7: For chronic cough considered to be related to asthma, cough-variant asthma, or allergic rhinitis, consider LTRA treatment on a case-by-case basis (2B).\n\nLeukotrienes are inflammatory lipid mediators formed from arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. They cause airway smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability, mucus secretion, and eosinophil chemotaxis. LTRAs exert anti-inflammatory effects by competitively binding leukotriene receptors and have been widely used in asthma, cough-variant asthma, and allergic rhinitis. However, LTRA is not a traditional antitussive, and in clinical practice there is overuse and off-label use of LTRA for chronic nonspecific cough in children. Multicenter studies in China show LTRA usage is high among children with chronic cough, and a survey of 12,809 outpatient prescriptions found montelukast off-label use accounted for 94.04%, with cough as a common off-label diagnosis.\n\nHowever, there is insufficient evidence that LTRA benefits children with chronic nonspecific cough. Potential adverse effects and interactions limit its use. A systematic review evaluating the safety and efficacy of LTRA for pediatric chronic nonspecific cough found only two eligible studies; one could not extract data specifically for chronic nonspecific cough, and the other had too small a sample to draw conclusions. Due to lack of evidence, the Korean Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the European Respiratory Society cough guidelines do not recommend LTRA for pediatric chronic nonspecific cough. In 2020, the U.S. FDA issued a safety warning about montelukast, highlighting mental health adverse effects such as sleep disturbance, insomnia, irritability, hallucinations, and depression. For cough considered to be related to asthma, cough-variant asthma, or allergic rhinitis, LTRA may be used at times but with regular follow-up to verify the etiology and adjust treatment accordingly. In primary care, avoid overuse of LTRA and strengthen adverse reaction monitoring to ensure rational use.\n\nClinical Question 4: Should cough children routinely use antibiotics? If there are indications for antibiotics, which antibiotics should be used?\n\nRecommendation 8: Do not routinely use antibiotics for acute cough in children (1A).\n\nRecommendation 9: When clinical suspicion of bacterial infection warrants antibiotic use, first-line oral amoxicillin or amoxicillin–clavulanate is recommended, with a standard course of 5–7 days. If penicillin allergy or drug availability issues exist, options include oral second-generation cephalosporins or macrolide antibiotics (2C).\n\nRecommendation 10: For children suspected of pertussis or Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia infection, first-line macrolide antibiotics are recommended (1B).\n\nRecommendation 11: For chronic wet cough in children without other diagnostic clues, after actively identifying etiology, empirical antibiotic treatment may be used; first-line is oral amoxicillin–clavulanate (7:1–14:1 ratio) 25–30 mg/(kg per dose), twice daily, with observation, watchful waiting, and follow-up. If PBB is considered, the course should be at least 2 weeks (1B).\n\nPediatric acute cough is usually viral and self-limiting. Early antibiotic use does not reduce cough or other symptoms or shorten illness and can cause adverse reactions and promote bacterial resistance; thus it is not routinely recommended. A systematic review found that delaying antibiotic use (at least 48 hours), immediate use, and no antibiotic use produced no significant differences in cough symptom relief, follow-up visits, or use of alternative medications among respiratory tract infections (primarily in children). Compared with immediate use, delaying antibiotics significantly reduced antibiotic use (OR = 0.03, 95% CI 0.01–0.07) with no difference in patient satisfaction or adverse events. A retrospective study suggested that initial antibiotic use during the first presentation of acute bronchitis was associated with a higher risk of recurrence of acute bronchitis (HR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.17–1.30) and a higher risk of recurrence when antibiotics were used again (HR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.99–2.28). Therefore, initial antibiotic use for acute cough should be strictly justified.\n\nWhen the acute cough course becomes prolonged or symptoms worsen, or if there is purulent sputum, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, or elevated inflammatory markers, especially in children with underlying diseases, consider bacterial infection and treat empirically according to likely pathogens. An RCT comparing amoxicillin–clavulanate with cefpodoxime for suspected bacterial lower respiratory tract infection showed no significant difference in efficacy (cured or improved: 96.7% vs 95.2%, P > 0.05) or adverse effects (7% vs 3.9%, P > 0.05). Because amoxicillin (or amoxicillin–clavulanate) is relatively narrow-spectrum, inexpensive, and effective against common respiratory pathogens, it is recommended as first-line until culture susceptibility testing is available. If penicillin allergy or drug availability issues exist, consider a second-generation cephalosporin or a macrolide. Monitor symptoms and adjust therapy based on susceptibility testing results when available.\n\nWhen acute cough becomes prolonged, or if paroxysmal or spasmodic coughing, “whoop-like” cough, or post-tussive emesis occur, pertussis should be considered. For suspected pertussis in children, early antibiotic treatment (within 1–2 weeks of onset) with a macrolide is recommended. A retrospective cohort study of adolescents and adults with pertussis found that early macrolide therapy (within 11 days of onset of coughing) significantly shortened cough duration compared with non-early treatment [20.0 days (95% CI 16–28) vs 30.5 days (95% CI 27–40), P = 0.002]. For infants aged 2 months and older who are intolerant or resistant to macrolides, or in macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae, co-trimoxazole can be used as an alternative, following the Pertussis Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (2023 edition). For preschool and school-age children presenting with fever, paroxysmal coughing, or early lung signs not obvious, consider empirical macrolide therapy for suspected Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia infections. In MP pneumonia treated with macrolides, if fever persists or clinical/lung imaging findings fail to improve after 72 hours, consider macrolide nonresponse–associated MP pneumonia and switch to a non-macrolide antibiotic as appropriate per guidelines (2023 edition).\n\nPBB is an important cause of chronic wet cough in children under five. If a lower airway specimen from a child with PBB yields growth of pathogens with a colony count ≥10^4 CFU/mL, the diagnosis is “microbiologically diagnosed PBB,” to distinguish from clinically diagnosed PBB. Common pathogens include non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, all of which are sensitive to amoxicillin–clavulanate. A systematic review found that among children with chronic wet cough, the antibiotic-treated group had fewer “not cured” or “no obvious improvement” outcomes than the non-treated group (OR = 0.15, 95% CI 0.07–0.31). European Respiratory Society guidelines suggest trying antibiotic therapy for chronic wet cough with normal chest X-ray, normal lung function, and no red flags. The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend antibiotics for 2 weeks for chronic wet cough in children without underlying diseases and without other specific indications. Regarding treatment duration, studies show no significant difference in clinical cure or cough recurrence between 2 weeks and 3–4 weeks of antibiotics; given concerns about resistance and adverse effects, long-term antibiotic use is not recommended, but treatment of PBB should last at least 2 weeks. Regarding dosing, there is no evidence that high-dose amoxicillin (90 mg/(kg·d)) is superior to standard dosing; this guideline recommends amoxicillin 25–30 mg/(kg·dose), twice daily. When using amoxicillin–clavulanate, be aware of the ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanate (7:1 to 14:1) to avoid excess clavulanate-related adverse effects.\n\nClinical Question 5: How to treat post-infectious cough (PIC) in the respiratory tract?\n\nRecommendation 12: Do not routinely use antibiotics for PIC (GPS).\n\nRecommendation 13: After differential diagnosis, for PIC with severe or persistent cough, consider judicious use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or LTRA or bronchodilators (2D).\n\nIn children after an acute respiratory infection, a cough lasting more than 4 weeks but less than 8 weeks with a normal chest X-ray or only increased bronchial markings and normal lung function or transient airway hyperresponsiveness can be diagnosed as PIC after excluding other causes of chronic cough. If cough lasts more than 8 weeks, PIC is less likely and other diagnoses should be considered. PIC has multiple etiologies, but viruses are the most common, hence it is also called “post-viral cough” or “cough after a respiratory viral infection.” PIC is self-limiting and usually resolves on its own; antibiotics do not relieve the cough or shorten the course and may cause adverse effects and promote antibiotic resistance; thus antibiotics are not routinely recommended. For a subset of persistent coughs, after thorough differential diagnosis of other causes of chronic cough, if infection factors are still considered, appropriate antibiotics can be selected according to etiological results and susceptibility testing.\n\nThe pathogenesis of PIC remains unclear, but is thought to involve multiple factors, including epithelial barrier disruption and widespread airway inflammation, with or without transient airway hyperreactivity, mucus hypersecretion, or impaired mucus clearance. Consequently, corticosteroids, LTRA, and bronchodilators are commonly used in clinical practice.\n\nResearch shows that inhaled budesonide can significantly reduce cough symptom scores in children with PIC. In vitro studies suggest budesonide pretreatment can significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2–induced airway epithelial permeability and decrease ACE2 expression. The anti-inflammatory effects of ICS can suppress airway inflammatory mediators and reduce airway hyperreactivity, potentially improving PIC caused by SARS-CoV-2. Several RCTs conducted in China indicate that montelukast combined with ICS and/or bronchodilators can effectively improve overall treatment response in children with PIC and is well tolerated. Chinese expert consensus recommends ICS for severe or persistent cough PIC; for PIC associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with atopic constitution and airway hyperreactivity, ICS, bronchodilators, and LTRA may be used. Therefore, after differential diagnosis, for PIC with severe or persistent cough not responding to routine symptomatic treatment, consideration can be given to ICS or LTRA or bronchodilators, with a better effect in atopic patients; monitor efficacy and discontinue promptly if cough does not improve, while continuing investigation of the underlying cause.\n\nClinical Question 6: What emergencies should coughing children be vigilant about?\n\nRecommendation 14: The main emergencies include obvious foreign body aspiration, acute laryngitis with laryngeal obstruction, severe or critical asthma attack, severe pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, left heart failure, etc. (2D).\n\nPediatric cough has a variety of causes; some may be mild and improve rapidly with treatment, while others may conceal potentially serious diseases. Without early recognition of life-threatening conditions, treatment may be delayed, leading to poor outcomes. Therefore, awareness of and ability to identify critical conditions early are essential.\n\nThe 2021 Chinese adult cough guideline notes the need to differentiate acute cough with or without critical illness—such as acute myocardial infarction, left heart failure, pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, and foreign body aspiration. In children, attention must also be paid to laryngeal diseases causing laryngeal obstruction and severe or critical asthma attacks.\n\nExplicit foreign body aspiration presents as sudden onset of irritating coughing, choking, and gagging with accompanying dyspnea. Acute laryngitis with laryngeal obstruction presents with a barking cough, inspiratory dyspnea, stridor, and hoarseness. In severe asthma attacks, signs such as mental status changes, inability to complete sentences, use of accessory respiratory muscles, inspiratory retractions, and a decline in wheeze should raise concern for a severe or life-threatening attack. In pneumonia, critical illness is indicated by general deterioration, altered consciousness, hypoxemia, high fever (hyperpyrexia or fever for more than 5 days), dehydration or poor oral intake, and abnormal chest imaging (≥2/3 unilateral infiltration, multilobar infiltration, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, atelectasis, necrosis, abscess). Pneumothorax and pulmonary embolism can present with cough, dyspnea, and chest pain, with pleural effusion or hypoxia; imaging and tests such as chest X-ray, ultrasound, and CT pulmonary angiography aid early differentiation. Cough with pink frothy sputum suggests left-sided heart failure due to pulmonary edema. Early recognition and prompt treatment or referral are critical.\n\nClinical Question 7: What extrathoracic signs can pediatric cough cause besides respiratory symptoms?\n\nRecommendation 15: Severe or prolonged cough can lead to extrathoracic manifestations involving cardiovascular, digestive, musculoskeletal, neurological/psychiatric, skin, and ocular systems, such as arrhythmias, nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, rib fractures, hypoxic brain injury, syncope, insomnia, depression, skin petechiae, purpura, and subconjunctival hemorrhage (2D).\n\nCough is an effective mechanism to clear excessive secretions and foreign material from the airways, but sustained severe coughing can lead to physical and psychological adverse events. Understanding the potential extrathoracic effects of cough helps frontline clinicians recognize the necessity of diagnosing and treating cough, and acknowledges its impact on the child’s overall quality of life, thereby guiding efforts to improve outcomes.\n\nA 2020 overview reviewed 286 articles to examine cough-related complications in children. Reported pediatric cough complications included hypoxic brain injury, syncope, rectal prolapse, gastroesophageal mucosal tears, mediastinal emphysema, tracheal rupture, pulmonary herniation, rib fractures, and reduced quality of life. In patients with comorbidities, some complications can lead to severe outcomes including death. Research on extra-thoracic complications of pediatric cough remains limited, underscoring the need for future multicenter, large-sample studies to determine incidence and the strength of association with cough.",

In other words, a person who smokes one pack per day receives about 24 mSv of radiation from smoking in a year, equivalent to standing outside the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant for 2 hours; a person who smokes 1.5 packs per day would exceed the annual safety standard for nuclear plant workers due to smoking; and a non-smoker who is frequently exposed to secondhand smoke would have an annual radiation dose from secondhand smoke exposure roughly equivalent to having 10 X-ray fluoroscopy examinations in a year. Some smokers may think that radiation exposure is relatively smaller for high-end cigarettes. In fact, because premium cigarettes tend to use a higher proportion of tobacco leaves, the proportion of tobacco stems is relatively lower, and polonium-210 is higher in tobacco leaves; thus the radioactivity of premium cigarettes often does not decrease, and may even be higher at times. The tobacco industry has long known about the radioactivity of cigarettes, but has concealed it from the public for as long as 40 years. A U.S. study examined more than 1,500 internal documents from several international tobacco companies. Among them, documents from Philip Morris Companies, the world’s largest tobacco company, show that most internal documents involving polonium-210 were not disclosed, because polonium-210 has been shown to cause lung cancer in animal experiments.\n\nRequirements:\n1.

      "problem_en": "3. Diagnosis and evaluation of pediatric cough\nClinical Question 1: What are the common etiologies of chronic cough in Chinese children?\nRecommendation 1: The common etiologies of chronic cough in Chinese children are cough variant asthma (CVA), upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), and post-infectious cough (PIC) (1B); account should be taken of differences in etiologies across different age groups, with PIC, CVA, and UACS being the common etiologies in children <6 years old; cardiogenic cough is more common in 6–14-year-old children [13]. As pediatricians’ understanding of UACS deepens, its diagnostic rate is also increasing. A single-center small-sample cross-sectional study suggested that for chronic cough in children aged 5 years and younger, the etiologies are in order UACS (37.6%), CVA (31.8%), and PIC (18.8%) [14]. Surveys of cough etiology should use year-long data, with differences related to geography and the diagnostic–treatment level of the hospitals conducting the survey [15].\n\nClinical Question 2: Do children with chronic cough need routine chest imaging?\nRecommendation 2: Chest X-ray is recommended as the initial evaluation method for chronic cough (1B); when chest X-ray cannot clearly identify the etiology, or when chronic wet cough in children presents with specific signs [e.g., digital clubbing] or high suspicion of airway foreign body aspiration, chest CT should be performed (2B). Chest X-ray can promptly and effectively assist in diagnosing specific cough. A multicenter study on etiologies of pediatric cough suggests the chest X-ray has a specificity of 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89–1.00], sensitivity 0.20 [95% CI: 0.16–0.26], positive predictive value 1.00 [95% CI: 0.92–1.00], and negative predictive value 0.15 [95% CI: 0.11–0.20], indicating that abnormal chest X-ray helps diagnose a specific cough, but a normal chest X-ray cannot exclude a specific cough [16]. Another prospective cohort study reached similar conclusions [17]. Therefore, chest X-ray is recommended as the initial evaluation for chronic cough in children. Another systematic review suggests that when the cause of chronic cough cannot be clearly identified, or when chronic wet cough has specific signs [e.g., digital clubbing] or high suspicion of airway foreign body aspiration, further evaluation such as chest CT should be considered [18].\n\nClinical Question 3: Do children with chronic cough need routine pulmonary function testing?\nRecommendation 3: For chronic cough in children aged ≥6 years, it is recommended to routinely perform pulmonary function testing (1B). A prospective cohort study found that pulmonary function testing diagnosing a specific chronic cough had specificity 1.00 (95% CI: 0.89–1.00), sensitivity 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01–0.06), positive predictive value 1.00 (95% CI: 0.69–1.00), and negative predictive value 0.13 (95% CI: 0.09–0.17) [16]. Another cohort study showed specificity 0.93 and sensitivity 0.17 for diagnosing a specific chronic cough. These two cohort studies consistently suggest that abnormal pulmonary function testing helps diagnose chronic cough etiologies, but a normal test cannot exclude a specific cough [17].\n\nClinical Question 4: Do chronic cough patients need fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) testing?\nRecommendation 4: For suspected CVA in chronic cough, FeNO testing is recommended as an adjunct diagnostic tool (2C). FeNO testing is a noninvasive, sensitive, and convenient method that reflects airway eosinophilic inflammation [19]. One study showed that FeNO testing for diagnosing pediatric CVA had specificity 0.94, sensitivity 0.84, area under the curve (AUC) 0.94, with an optimal cutoff point of 25.5 × 10^-9 [20]. Systematic reviews suggest FeNO has high diagnostic value for adult CVA [21–23], and a 2020 systematic review reported FeNO diagnosing adult CVA specificity 0.82 (95% CI: 0.80–0.84), sensitivity 0.74 (95% CI: 0.70–0.77), AUC 0.87 [21]; another systematic review suggested FeNO for adult non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB) has relatively lower diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.77–0.84) [22]. However, because FeNO in children is influenced by race, sex, age, height, and cooperation during testing [24–25], and because there is no unified cutoff value for diagnosing CVA in children, FeNO testing is recommended only for suspected CVA in chronic cough.\n\nClinical Question 5: Do chronic cough patients need routine allergen testing (skin prick tests or serum-specific IgE testing)?\nRecommendation 5: Routine allergen testing is not recommended for chronic cough in children; for suspected allergy-related chronic cough, allergen testing is recommended (1C). A case-control study using multivariate analysis found that an individual’s atopic status did not affect cough counts or scores, arguing against routine allergen testing in chronic cough [26]. A diagnostic accuracy study found that house dust mite–specific IgE testing had a specificity of 0.97 and sensitivity of 0.89 for diagnosing allergic asthma; skin prick testing had specificity 0.91 and sensitivity 0.79 [27]. Therefore, for children with suspected allergy-related chronic cough, allergen assessment helps distinguish allergic asthma from other nonspecific coughs.\n\nClinical Question 6: When is bronchoscopy required for chronic cough?\nRecommendation 6: Bronchoscopy should be considered when noninvasive routine investigations cannot clearly establish the cause of chronic cough or when there is a high suspicion of airway malformation, airway obstruction, or foreign body, based on history and clinician judgment (2C). Bronchoscopy helps to confirm or exclude cough etiologies not detectable by routine investigations, such as protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), airway foreign bodies, tracheobronchomalacia, and endobronchial tuberculosis. A systematic review suggests that when chronic wet cough in children has specific coughing features or when chronic wet cough does not improve after 4 weeks of antibiotics, bronchoscopy should be further completed; observed abnormalities may include tracheal and bronchial malacia, and purulent secretions in the airway [18]. Another systematic review indicates that the risk of serious complications from bronchoscopy is low [for example bleeding probability 2.5%–89.9%, 89.7% of bleedings are mild (about 100 mL) cases; pneumothorax incidence 0–4%], with zero mortality, indicating good safety [28].\n\nClinical Question 7: When should chronic cough patients be referred to pediatric respiratory specialty?\nRecommendation 7: Chronic cough patients who do not improve after 2 weeks or more of empirical treatment by primary care physicians or non-respiratory specialists, or who show underlying disease or potential serious disease, should be referred to pediatric respiratory specialists (2C). Timely referral helps identify rare etiologies and complex situations, ensuring precise diagnosis and treatment. The urgency of referral depends on the patient’s clinical status and the severity of potential disease. There is limited research on referral timing; several pediatric cough guidelines note that chronic cough patients who remain symptomatic after empirical treatment should consider referral [6,29–31]. The expert panel’s consensus on referral is based on this.\n722\nChin J Pediatr, September 2021, Vol. 59, No. 9",

Physical examination: Temperature 36.8°C, heart rate 130 beats/min, respiration 40 breaths/min, weight 8 kg. A grade III systolic murmur was audible in the precordial area, rough and widely transmitted. Bilateral breath sounds clear, no dry or wet rales. Abdomen soft, liver and spleen not palpable below the costal margin. Distal limbs warm, capillary refill time normal. After admission, relevant investigations were completed, including complete blood count, coagulation function, liver and renal function, electrolytes, ECG, chest X-ray and echocardiography, etc. Echocardiography showed congenital heart disease, a membranous portion ventricular septal defect about 8 mm in size, left-to-right shunt, and mild pulmonary arterial hypertension. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, prominent pulmonary artery segment, and increased markings in both lungs.\nPostoperatively, the patient was transferred to the Pediatric Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CICU), receiving continuous ECG monitoring, invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring, central venous pressure monitoring, and intermittent transcutaneous oxygen saturation monitoring. Ventilatory support was provided, mode SIMV + PSV, settings: tidal volume 8–10 mL/kg, respiratory rate 20–25 breaths/min, inspiratory pressure support 10–15 cmH₂O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 4–6 cmH₂O. Vital signs were closely observed, recorded every 30 minutes.\nPostoperatively, continuous infusion of dopamine and milrinone and other vasopressor drugs was used to maintain blood pressure stability and support cardiac function. Based on central venous pressure and urine output, IV fluids were adjusted reasonably, strictly controlling input/output balance to avoid fluid overload.\nPostoperatively, close monitoring of pericardial and mediastinal drainage volume and characteristics, recorded hourly. In the first 4 hours, drainage was about 80 mL, then gradually decreased, color changing from bright red to light red. At 24 hours postoperative, drainage was about 120 mL, and the pericardial and mediastinal drains were removed.\nPostoperative Day 1, the child’s circulation was stable, with vasopressor use gradually reduced. Rechecks of complete blood count, coagulation, liver and kidney function, and electrolytes showed results basically normal. An attempt was made to wean from the ventilator, switching to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); spontaneous breathing was good, arterial blood gas analysis was normal; about 20 hours postoperatively, weaning from the ventilator was successful, endotracheal tube was removed, and oxygen was provided via a face mask.\nPostoperative Day 2, the child’s mental status markedly improved, started small feeds, every 2–3 hours, 20–30 mL per feed, with no vomiting or choking after feeding. Feeding volume was gradually increased, and supplementary foods were added as tolerated. At the same time, the child was encouraged to perform limb activities in bed to prevent thrombosis and muscle atrophy.\nPostoperative Day 3, the child’s condition remained stable, transferred from CICU to the general ward. Continued anti-infection therapy, nutritional/miocardial support, and symptomatic treatment. Recheck echocardiography, which showed no residual shunt at the repair site of the ventricular septal defect; cardiac structure and function recovered well. The child continued rehabilitation in the general ward, gradually increasing activity; the incision healed well at 1 week postoperatively, stitches removed, discharge.\nAt discharge, the physician carefully explained post-discharge precautions to the parents, including dietary adjustments, infection prevention, regular follow-up, etc., and scheduled follow-up at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively.\nBased on the above patient information, help formulate a discharge rehabilitation plan, with special notice to the parents regarding certain precautions and caregiver guidance, and finally attach the schedule for regular follow-up.",

      "problem_en": "Expert medical translation Chinese→English, maintain clinical accuracy: Abnormal signal in the distal femoral metaphysis, possible fibrous cortical defect, recommend follow-up (male, 11 years old), [image message] Hello, may I ask what symptoms the child has? He says knee pain, one is the CT report, one is the MRI report. CT looks normal; MRI is more sensitive. CT did not show bone destruction, so it’s not a big deal. Does the MRI report count as an injury? Is there a situation where the road is impassable? It’s not that we doubt an injury; we suspect a bone abnormality (lesion), but CT did not show bone abnormality, indicating nothing wrong, regular follow-up is enough. Here is the situation! Yesterday I started riding an electric scooter and bumped into a child! Just tell me simply and clearly: is there an injury? No injury; more precisely, no fracture. Is the bone abnormality his own problem? Then why would his knee hurt to the point he can’t walk! Besides fractures, soft tissues such as muscles and ligaments can be injured after being bumped and cause pain. Recommend symptomatic treatment, MRI re-check in three months. Abnormal signal in the distal femoral metaphysis, possible fibrous cortical defect, recommend follow-up (male, 11 years old). Is this test report due to being bumped or due to his own body? The MRI shows abnormal signals; cannot say it is a lesion, it is suspicious; can be stated that there is no fracture, but we cannot determine whether it is intrinsic disease or trauma, so a three-month follow-up is needed. If after three months the follow-up shows no abnormal signals, then consider trauma as the cause; if after three months the follow-up is still the same or the abnormal signals worsen, then consider intrinsic disease. How to treat trauma! You can use topical medicated plasters to relieve pain. In other words, soft tissue contusion! Will it get better in a few days? Soft tissue injury should be present, and medications should target soft tissue injury, but the cause of the bone signal abnormality cannot yet be confirmed. Soft tissue injuries generally recover in about a week. Do you understand what I’m saying! I started my vehicle and bumped into a child (the child is not my own)! Looking at the MRI report, what responsibility do I bear! Bone signal abnormality requires a three-month follow-up to see if it is related to me. Can the doctor help you analyze the condition? Responsibility needs to be determined by the traffic police. Bone abnormality may be related to trauma, or it may be unrelated; a further three-month follow-up is needed to confirm. What does bone abnormality mean? Distal femoral metaphyseal signal abnormality; CT has been done, fracture excluded. If follow-up remains abnormal, is it due to intrinsic disease or due to being hit? If after three months follow-up is still abnormal, it’s intrinsic disease; if follow-up is normal, it’s trauma-induced signal abnormality. Trauma-induced signal abnormality, i.e., soft tissue injury! Rest for a few days and it will be fine? Soft tissue injuries generally improve noticeably in about a week. It’s understood that bone injuries come in many forms; the more serious is fracture, which can be seen on X-ray and CT; milder ones like bone contusion and bone marrow edema cannot be seen on CT, but MRI can show signal abnormalities. These signal abnormalities are hard to distinguish from intrinsic bone lesions like fibrous cortical defect.

It typically presents at a younger age, with mild clinical symptoms and a family history. In 1991, Bell et al. localized the pathogenic gene locus on the long arm of chromosome 20 in a large MODY family, naming it MODY1, which laid the foundation for identifying the pathogenic gene of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) as the MODY1 gene. The following year, Froguel et al. discovered the second MODY gene locus on the short arm of chromosome 7 and confirmed it to be the glucokinase (GCK) gene, i.e., MODY2. Subsequently, the MODY1 gene was confirmed to be HNF4A, and other MODY genes such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) and pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor-1 (PDX-1) have been identified; to date, 14 MODY types have been reported.",

Actually, this is a special type of diabetes, first discovered by scientists in 1975. Unlike the common type 1 and type 2 diabetes, MODY patients usually develop in adolescence, with relatively mild symptoms, but one notable feature—the family history is very prominent!\n\n🔍In 1991, scientists Bell and his team, while studying a large MODY family, first mapped a pathogenic gene locus on the long arm of chromosome 20; this important discovery was named MODY1. This finding not only uncovered a portion of MODY's genetic secrets, but also laid the foundation for subsequent research, especially confirming that the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4A) gene is a key factor causing MODY1.\n\n🔬Subsequently in 1992, Froguel et al. identified a second MODY gene locus on the short arm of chromosome 7; this time they confirmed the glucokinase (GCK) gene, i.e., the pathogenic gene for MODY2. Subsequently, more research on MODY continued, confirming multiple MODY-related genes, such as HNF1A and PDX-1, and to date there are 14 distinct MODY types, each with its own unique features and inheritance patterns.\n\n📚Understanding MODY not only helps us better understand the diversity and complexity of diabetes, but also provides new ideas and directions for precision medicine and personalized treatment. If you or your family have similar symptoms, it is recommended to consult a professional doctor as early as possible, undergo detailed examinations and diagnosis, manage health in a timely manner, and enjoy a healthy life!💪\n\n#Diabetes #MODY #GeneticDisease",

      "problem_en": "Currently, treatment options for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures primarily include biological healing (non-surgical treatment), conventional surgical treatment, and minimally invasive surgery (vertebral augmentation). When the diameter of a bone defect exceeds 5 cm, it is termed a supercritical-size bone defect; at this size, the defect cannot be fully repaired by the body's own reparative capacity. Clinically, autografts, xenografts, and other approaches are commonly used to repair supercritical bone defects, however these methods are severely limited by donor shortages, disease transmission, and immune rejection. Therefore, artificial bone grafting is an important avenue for treating supercritical bone defects, among which vertebral augmentation has attracted wide attention for its ability to rapidly relieve pain and restore vertebral strength and stiffness.\n\nIn vertebral augmentation surgery, bone cement plays a crucial role, but traditional bone cement has many shortcomings compared with autologous bone tissue. Existing calcium phosphate products are most similar in composition to bone, but they all face the challenge of relatively low mechanical strength. Currently, the calcium phosphate product most likely to be used clinically is hydroxyapatite bone cement, but its degradation performance is poor and nearly non-degradable, thereby preventing ingrowth of new bone.\n\nTo address this issue, the Suzhou University Orthopaedic Research Institute and the team led by Li Bin and Chen Song from Suzhou University successfully developed a novel porous calcium phosphate bone cement. The team used β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) and monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (MCPM) as the solid phase and innovatively employed ferric ammonium citrate (AFC) solution as the liquid phase, producing bone cement with an average compressive strength above 60 MPa. The new porous calcium phosphate bone cement features a collagen/calcium phosphate microstructure with an orderly arrangement, highly similar to the natural bone matrix. Its preparation process also mimics the natural bone mineralization process in the body, achieving multi-level biomimicry in composition, structure, and processing, thereby overcoming the low mechanical strength problem of calcium phosphate bone cement. It is also degradable; as the cement degrades, new bone grows in, addressing the issue of lack of new bone ingrowth into calcium phosphate bone cement. Furthermore, compared with the PMMA bone cement currently used clinically, the porous calcium phosphate bone cement shows good biocompatibility and does not generate heat during hydration, expanding the cement’s range of applications. The development, promotion, and clinical translation of this porous calcium phosphate bone cement provide a solid blueprint for treating various types of bone defects.",
      "answer_en": "Imagine your spine is like an old house, dilapidated and with cracks appearing in the walls. At this point, you have several repair options: one is to wait for it to heal slowly (like waiting for the cracks in the wall to disappear), one is to hire craftsmen to undertake a major repair (traditional surgery), and another is to hire a handyman to do a quick patch (minimally invasive surgery).\n\nHowever, when the holes in the wall exceed 5 centimeters, a simple patch is no longer sufficient. At this stage, the so-called “borrowing bricks” approach is usually used—that is, bringing material from elsewhere to repair (autografts, xenografts). But the problem with “borrowing bricks” is that there may not be enough bricks, the borrowed bricks may carry pathogens, and they may not fit well (immune rejection), so this option is not always reliable.\n\nThus, artificial bone grafting has become a valuable helper for repairing large cavities, especially the vertebral augmentation therapy that can rapidly relieve pain and restore the vertebra to its original shape, which is particularly popular. In this process, bone cement is like the cement used in construction, but compared with the patient’s own bone, traditional bone cement and the native bone still have some gaps.\n\nNow, Li Bin and Chen Song’s team at Suzhou University are like superheroes in the construction world; they have invented a new type of “bone cement,” as if the house were equipped with a high-tech material. This material not only has a composition very similar to native bone but is also exceptionally strong (compressive strength above 60 MPa), and over time it will gradually resorb, allowing new bone to grow in naturally, solving the problem of new bone ingrowth that traditional materials could not achieve.\n\nEven more remarkably, this new “bone cement” will not generate heat or temperature fluctuations during setting like traditional PMMA bone cement, avoiding the trouble of thermal expansion and contraction. In short, this new material provides a whole new, expansive avenue for repairing various bone problems, giving clinicians more options when treating bone defects.",
